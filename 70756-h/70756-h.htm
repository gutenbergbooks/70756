  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='large'>MRS. BRADY UNDERSTANDS HER POSITION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Tacitly Kingslough had decided that Mrs.
Brady was not to be visited. Just as by one
consent the public sometimes agrees to condemn
an untried man, so gentle and simple
made up their minds not to enter the gates of
Maryville.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those of Nettie’s own class, having regard
to that which they considered a <i><span lang="fr">mésalliance</span></i>,
quietly tabooed the fact of her marriage and
her existence; those of a lower grade, remembering
what Miss O’Hara’s father had
been, and what the Rileys were, feeling if they
called upon the young wife she might not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>feel grateful for their attentions, agreed it
might be prudent for them to abstain from
showing any.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wherein they were wise. Scant civility
would any one have met from Nettie, who,
presuming upon an altered position, had tried
to force unwelcome acquaintanceship on her.
Mrs. Brady was not one to be satisfied with
dry bread when she had expected to feast on
cake.</p>

<p class='c010'>She could do without either. That was
what the uplifting of her little head and the
defiant flash of her blue eyes silently informed
society.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She could live alone, she would live
alone,” this the burden of her talk to Mrs.
Hartley, who, being above or below the considerations
that usually influenced the going
and coming of Kingslough’s upper ten, could
afford to set precedence and public opinion at
defiance, hired the best covered car Kingslough
boasted, and drove solemnly out to Maryville
to see the bride, and give her some old-fashioned
advice as to the way in which she was to order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>her future conduct, and make a good thing of
the years that had still to come, still to be
lived somehow, happily or miserably, creditably
or the reverse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One day,” Mrs. Brady proceeded,
“perhaps they” (they stood for the retired
officers of the army and navy, the clergy,
the attorneys and agents, the widows,
old maids, poodles, and others who constituted
the aristocracy of Kingslough)
“may wish to know me again, and then I
will have nothing to do with them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When that day comes,” said Mrs. Hartley,
with the coolness which exasperated so many
of her acquaintances, “you will of course have
as perfect a right to select the houses at which
you choose to visit as the Kingslough people
have now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Or as I have now,” amended Nettie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pardon me, I think your selection is at
present confined to those at which you will
not visit,” answered Mrs. Hartley. “It is of
no use, Nettie,” she went on, stroking the
bright, fair hair kindly and sorrowfully, “it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of no use trying to fight the world single-handed.
You are very young and you are
very pretty, and you have a will of your own
and a temper of your own that few gave you
credit for possessing; but neither youth nor
beauty, nor obstinacy, nor being at bottom
a little atom of a vixen will win this battle for
you. If you take an old woman’s advice, you
will lay down your arms, and let people
imagine you are still the gentle, quiet Nettie
they used to see going to school. You cannot
eat your cake and have it. You knew perfectly
what Kingslough thought, whether
rightly or wrongly, of Mr. Brady, and still
you chose to marry Mr. Brady. Now you
want Mr. Brady and Kingslough as well; at
least, you are bitter because Kingslough has
not welcomed your return with open arms.
What you ought to say to yourself now is,
‘Never mind, I have got my husband to care
for and to love me, and so long as we are
happy together, no slights the world chooses
to put upon us can affect us much;’” and as
Mrs. Hartley ended this very proper sentence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>she looked closely and curiously at Nettie,
who, muttering something about the heat
of the room, rose and opened one of the
windows.</p>

<p class='c010'>It proved rather a long operation, but when
she returned to her seat the flush Mrs. Hartley
had noticed rising even to her temples had not
faded quite away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Next time you come to see me,” Nettie
began, ignoring the previous subject of conversation,
“I hope you will find the house
looking more comfortable. We have furniture
coming from Kilcurragh, but it cannot be here
for a few days.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear,” said Mrs. Hartley, “furniture
does not necessarily mean happiness, any
more than—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I know that, of course!” Nettie
interrupted, a little peevishly; “still one would
wish to have a few chairs, and perhaps a
couple of tables in a sitting-room, for all
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was characteristic of Mrs. Brady that she
elected to receive her visitor in the drawing-room,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>which looked like a barren wilderness,
and contained very few more articles of
furniture than when she first beheld its gaunt
and pretentious nakedness, rather than in the
smaller apartment where John Riley and
his father had held their interview with her
husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Hartley sat on the dilapidated sofa
while Nettie tried to look comfortable on a
very hard and very high, straight-backed
chair. Three windows, reaching from the
floor almost to the ceiling, looked out on
the weed-grown garden and the tangled
wilderness beyond, so that the visitor had
plenty of light to view the old-fashioned
chimney-piece, on the white marble of which
cupids disported themselves, holding wreaths
that seemed almost black with dirt—black and
grimy as the wings of the cupids.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless a handsome chimney-piece—handsome
and fantastic, like the great
chandelier that hung in the centre of the
room, and seemed to Mrs. Hartley’s critical
eye to stand in as much need of a scrubbing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>as the floor itself, from contact with which
she had carefully preserved her own dress, and
would fain have advised Nettie to guard her
muslin, had that young lady seemed more
amenable to common sense, and less sensitive
concerning the loss of social position induced
by her marriage.</p>

<p class='c010'>To Mrs. Hartley it did not signify in what
rank Mrs. Brady was now supposed to be, and
she felt sorry to notice how much it appeared
to signify to Nettie. She had known girls
make foolish matches before, and she had seen
them put up with the consequences, but never
before had she beheld a young wife battling
like Nettie against the results entailed by
her own act.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dimly she began to fancy that the girl
had married less for love of Mr. Brady than
for weariness of her monotonous life, and that
now, when the new life promised to be as
monotonous as the old, and there was, besides
no hope of escape from it, the hitherto unsuspected
side of Nettie’s character was beginning
to crop up. But Mrs. Hartley, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>partly right, was yet greatly wrong, both
in her premises and the results she deduced
from them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nettie had staked everything she owned—everything
that seemed of value to her—in
order to gain her husband, and now she
knew he was not worth the price at which she
purchased him. She had made a mistake
which she would never be able to remedy.
No; not if she lived for a hundred years, and
it was not in her nature to forgive society for
deserting and leaving her to bear the consequences
of her error as best she might, all
alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had taken her own course, and that
course had made her bankrupt. The world
might have helped to render the lot she had
chosen happier, but virtually the world had
turned its back upon her and said, “You may
carry your burden as best you can. You
may bear your trouble as well as you are
able.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That was the secret of Nettie’s anger and
Nettie’s petulance. Her heart was bleeding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>and not a hand was stretched forth to stanch it.
Such fearful isolation, such utter desertion
were almost maddening to Nettie, who had
always thought a good deal of herself, and
to whom it never occurred for one moment that
when she went off with Mr. Brady, she took
leave of her relatives and society at the same
time.</p>

<p class='c010'>She could have quarrelled with her own
shadow. She would have liked to strike some
one, to scold as a very virago, and so get
rid of even a part of the anger and sorrow,
and disappointment and humiliation that were
raging within her. She had gone as far as she
dared with Mrs. Hartley, but to no purpose.
She had tried to exhibit her grievances, and
her sensible visitor plainly said she had none;
implying rather, indeed, that society and her
relatives were aggrieved instead. It was
all very hard upon Nettie, and had Mrs.
Hartley only suspected how thoroughly the
girl already realized the completeness of her
mistake, she might have dealt more gently
with the blue-eyed beauty, whose pretty face
had brought such ruin on her life.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>As it was, Mrs. Hartley felt a little provoked
with her former favourite.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elderly people are apt to be a little severe
upon young ones when the ways and thoughts
of the latter are beyond their comprehension;
and Mrs. Hartley was severe in her judgment
of Nettie, more especially when their conversation
turned, as it soon did, upon Miss
Moffat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have heard from Grace, I suppose?”
said Mrs. Hartley.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have. She told you she had written to
me, of course?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Hartley wondered at the “of course,”
but contented herself, with answering
“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did she tell you also what she had sent
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; I do not think, whatever her faults
may be, Grace is a girl to talk to one friend
about any gift she might intend to make to
another.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She sent me this!” Nettie exclaimed,
pulling out of her belt an extremely beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and expensive watch, which. Mrs. Hartley
recognized as one formerly belonging to Miss
Moffat. “She said in her letter she would
have bought me a new one—” for a moment
the speaker’s voice trembled, and she hesitated
before finishing her sentence, “but in that case
she must wait until her father went to Dublin,
and she did not want to wait, and, besides
that, she had worn this so constantly, it was
like sending me a piece of herself, as she
could not come to see me. And there was
something besides the watch and chain.”
Here Nettie, apparently on the brink of a
confidence, broke off abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>I</em> wanted to return her presents,” she went
on, after a pause, and Mrs. Hartley noticed
how nervously and passionately the fingers of
her clasped hands laced and twisted round and
about, in and out of one another. “I would
have sent them back, but Mr. Brady would
not let me. I would not have kept anything
in the house sent by a person who thought
herself too good to come and see me; but I
could not help myself. It is not with any goodwill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>I wear this thing. I would rather Gracie
had come to see me than that anybody had
given me ten thousand pounds; and if she did
not like to do that, she ought not to have made
me presents, and I told her so; Mr. Brady
could not prevent my doing that, and I did it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you ought to be ashamed of your
ungrateful childishness!” exclaimed Mrs.
Hartley; “and I only wish Mr. Brady could
have prevented such an exhibition of temper.
It is nothing but temper which is the matter
with you, Nettie; and if you do not take care,
you will lose the few friends who have remained
true to you, and who will remain true
to you if you choose to let them, foolish and
inconsiderate though your conduct may have
been.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Friends!” repeated Nettie scornfully, but
tears filled her eyes as she spoke, and Mrs.
Hartley, seeing them, relented.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have friends, dear,” she said. “John
Riley is your friend, so am I, so is Grace. I
am an old woman, and free to go where
and to whom I choose; but Grace is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>free, she cannot come to see you, she cannot
set up her own opinion against that of
all her advisers. She has no mother; you
know yourself how little of a protector Mr.
Moffat is capable of being, and till she marries
it behoves her to be careful and prudent.
I think I may safely say, had Grace been Mrs.
Riley, you would have seen her here the day
she heard of your arrival: as it is—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She ought to have taken no notice of me,
I should have felt it less,” finished Nettie.
“Tell her though, Mrs. Hartley,” she went on,
kneeling before that lady, and resting her
arms across her lap, while she turned up her
face, which looked at the moment pathetically
beautiful, towards her mentor, “tell her I am
sorry for writing that nasty letter; tell her I
did not mean half nor a quarter what I said in
it; but I was angry, I was hurt; she ought
not to have sent me money, it was like buying
me off. It was treating me like a beggar.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is difficult to please every one,” remarked
Mrs. Hartley; “I am treated frequently
like a thief, because I do not send
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>money to those who have no right to it. But
proceed. How did Grace happen so far to
forget what was due to your feelings as to
make this present?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not laugh at me—oh! don’t,” entreated
Nettie; “I thought Grace was fond of me, and
it seemed so hard, so cold!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Grace is fond of you, and she is neither
hard nor cold. What did she say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can see her letter, if you care to read
it,” Nettie answered; and she went into the
next room and fetched Miss Moffat’s epistle.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a simple, loving scrawl—Grace wrote
an abominable hand—and told how earnestly
the writer hoped Nettie would be happy, and
how she wished she could go and see her, and
how she sent a little token by which Nettie
would know she was not forgotten; and how,
thinking there must be many things Nettie
might want to buy in the way of dress, she enclosed
her some money, which she hoped Nettie
would take from her as if she was her sister.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nothing could have been more tenderly or
delicately worded—there was not a sentence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>not a syllable in the letter which could have
given offence to any one who happened to be
in a better frame of mind than was Mrs.
Brady’s case when she received it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Never before, Mrs. Hartley felt, had she
quite appreciated Grace Moffat. Certainly
there was a sweetness and softness about her
mentally which Nettie lacked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did not stand in need of this money,”
she said, folding up the letter and returning
it, “or else you never could have resented a
kindness so gracefully offered, or the feeling
which prompted that kindness. What was the
amount of her enclosure?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fifty pounds,” answered Nettie, slowly
and reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Upon my word, Miss Grace, when you
come into your own, you will do things right
royally!” remarked Mrs. Hartley. She was
astonished at the idea of Miss Moffat proffering
such a sum, and yet while blaming the girl’s
reckless generosity, as she privately styled it,
she was touched by it sensibly. Middle-aged
people, who, having learned the value of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>money, look at a shilling twice before they
spend sixpence, are not always displeased at
the spectacle of a lavish liberality on the part
of young folks. Nevertheless, she intended to
remonstrate with Miss Moffat, to point out the
evil and folly of her pecuniary ways, and read
her a lecture, which she well knew beforehand
would be answered with many an “Ah, no!”
and “Dear Mrs. Hartley,” and “Well, but,”
and earnest excuse and playful protest, uttered
by that soft, sweet, stealing voice which was—the
Englishwoman confessed it with shame—almost
reconciling her to the Irish accent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you really do not require the money,
Nettie, I should return the whole or part of
it,” said Mrs. Hartley, forgetful apparently of
the statement Mrs. Brady had made when the
subject of Grace was first broached.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot,” Nettie answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, spent it all already!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” she replied; “I have given it
away,” and once again the tell-tale colour
flamed in Nettie’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>No good purpose was to be served in continuing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>that conversation, so Mrs. Hartley
immediately guessed, and changed it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Grace has refused John Riley,” she began.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I hear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you hear it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“John told me, and I am very sorry. I did
not say I was sorry to Grace because she might
not believe me, but I am. She will never
meet with any person one half so fond of her
for herself as John.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I agree with you there,” said Mrs.
Hartley briskly; “but why do you imagine
Grace would not have believed you felt sorry,
if you told her you did?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! because I used to be foolish about
things,” answered Nettie, looking straight
down the dreary expanse of uncarpeted floor
that stretched between her and the other end
of the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“About what things?” asked Mrs. Hartley.</p>

<p class='c010'>“About lovers and husbands, and other
nonsense of that sort,” Nettie replied, as if she
were five hundred years old. “I thought no
girl <em>could</em> care for a man unless he was handsome;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>and John is not handsome, you know.
You remember the saying, Mrs. Hartley, that
it is better to be ‘good than bonny.’ I did
not believe anybody could be good who was
not bonny. I have learned better since then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Hartley did not care to inquire “since
when?” so she merely remarked,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were therefore, I suppose, always influencing
Grace against him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She did not need any influencing,” was
the calm reply. “She did not care for him—not—not
in that way, and she did think he
wanted her money as much as herself; perhaps
he did, he has not much of his own to spare;
and then she met Mr. Somerford, and he took
her fancy with his playing and singing, and
talk about painting, and rubbish of that sort.
No,” added Nettie abruptly, reverting to the
question of Miss Moffat’s rejected lover, “we
did not often speak about John. She always
said she never intended to marry any one; and
of course I had to listen, and seem to believe
her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did not think she expressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>her real intention, then?” suggested Mrs.
Hartley.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not sure. I think Grace is likely
enough to stay single all her days; unless she
marries Mr. Somerford, or some person like
him; and I hope she will not marry Mr.
Somerford, I do, from my heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Nettie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I do not think he is good enough
for her. He has nothing inside his head excepting
selfishness and the roots of his curly-black
hair,” criticized Mrs. Brady, whose ideas on the
subject of physiology were vague in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Hartley laughed. Disparagement of
that handsome scion of a worthless stock was
very music to her ears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And besides,” proceeded Nettie, “I am
certain Grace would never be happy, stuck up
amongst the peerage. I know she and the
countess are now never separate; but she
must be a greatly altered girl if she cares very
much for being intimate with the nobility.
However, there is no knowing,” finished the
speaker sententiously. “I suppose we are none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of us exactly what we seem,” and blue eyes
and golden curls relapsed into reverie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is your husband?” inquired Mrs.
Hartley, after a moment’s pause. She had
hoped to see him, and she did not wish to end
her visit without doing so.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Brady,” said Nettie (it was a noticeable
feature in the young wife’s conversation
that since the day when General Riley and his
son came upon her, standing by the broken
sun-dial, she had never spoken of her husband
as such, or addressed or referred to him by
his Christian name); “Oh! he has gone down
the Lough as far as Port Clune, to look at
some cattle he is thinking of buying. It saves
ten or twelve miles going by water instead of
round the headlands; but he cannot be back
before the evening. I am sorry it has so
happened; he will be grieved to have missed
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It struck Mrs. Hartley that although Mr.
Brady might possibly be grieved, Mrs. Brady
was certainly not sorry; but she was rising to
take her leave, taking Nettie’s statement apparently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>for granted, when the door opened, and
the person of whom they had been speaking
walked in.</p>

<p class='c010'>At sight of a visitor he hesitated for a
moment, then came across the room and said
how glad he was to see Mrs. Hartley, how
proud to make her acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not know any one was here,” he
added (which must have been a mere figure of
speech, since he had seen Mrs. Hartley’s car,
and learned from the servant to whom it belonged),
“or I should not have appeared before
you in such a plight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where have you been? what have you
been doing?” inquired his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been in the water,” he replied,
“bringing Lady Glendare back to land. She
got out of her depth, or caught by a current,
or something of that sort, and would most
likely have been part of her way back to
England by this time, had we not happened to
be passing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You ought to change your clothes at once,”
remarked Mrs. Hartley, practical and unemotional
as ever.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“There is no hurry,” answered Mr. Brady,
laughing. “Mr. Moffat insisted on my taking
an internal antidote against cold; and, besides,
salt water never hurts anybody.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the countess?” inquired Nettie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! there is not much the matter with her
beyond fright. She was terrified. Miss
Moffat, I suspect, has not come off so well.
She was sitting at the door of the bathing-box
when Lady Glendare’s maid screamed, and in
one moment (by George, I never saw anything
so quick or so well done in my life) she was
out along the rocks (how she kept her footing
I cannot imagine), and made one leap after her
ladyship. I was near the countess by that
time, and Calpin had rowed in shore, so we
saved them both; but Miss Moffat is hurt, I
know, though she will not confess it. What
a girl that is!” finished Mr. Brady reflectively;
“what a spirit she has! The first words she
said to the countess, as Calpin and I were
carrying her ladyship up to Bayview, were,
‘Of course there is no fear of the election
now?’ I rather fancy the election was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>matter of secondary importance to Lady Glendare
at that moment; but Miss Moffat was
right, nevertheless.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Hartley looked straight at Mr. Brady
while he uttered the foregoing sentence. He
was a handsome man, no one could deny that;
handsome after his kind; and there was really
nothing in the words he spoke calculated to
annoy any one. But there was a manner
about him that offended the lady’s taste.
More especially she hated the tone in which he
alluded to Grace; and she felt angry with
Grace for having made any remark capable of
repetition in the presence of such a person.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am certain that your husband ought not
to be standing here in his wet clothes,” she
said, turning to Nettie. “If you name an
evening when you and Mr. Brady can come
and take a cup of tea with me, I will not intrude
any longer upon you to-day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not think,” Nettie was beginning,
when Mr. Brady interrupted her,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Annette and I have not so many engagements,
Mrs. Hartley, that we need hesitate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>about accepting yours,” he said. “Any evening
which suits you will be agreeable to us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thursday, then?” suggested the lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thursday, with many thanks,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know what that means, I suppose?”
remarked Nettie, when he returned, after helping
Mrs. Hartley into her car. “She does not
want us to call when we might meet other
visitors, but asks us to tea when she will take
good care to have nobody there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nettie had not lived behind the scenes of
high life in Kingslough for nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind,” returned her husband, “it
is the thin edge of the wedge;” and he went
out to state to some of his astonished labourers
that he wanted the drive weeded, gravelled,
and rolled, and that they were to set about
putting it in order immediately.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='large'>COMING EVENTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Nothing but the desire of annoying Mrs.
Somerford could have reconciled Lady Glendare
to the bi- or tri-weekly dip with which
she sought, and not unsuccessfully, to increase
the earl’s popularity amongst the Whigs of
Kingslough and its dependencies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ninon de l’Enclos, we are assured, preserved
her beauty by a plentiful use of water; but
then that was rain water, and not salt, used
also in privacy and under comfortable, not to
say luxurious, circumstances; and, besides, she
was an exception to most rules,—certainly, if
she pinned her faith to water pure and simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>as a conservator of good looks, an exception to
one.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for Lady Glendare, she never made a
secret of her antipathy to what she styled the
horrid and indecent practice of bathing in the
sea. Exclusive in all her ideas, a Tory in
every turn of her mind except as regarded the
politics she professed, Lady Glendare looked
upon soap and water, more especially water,
as methods of cleansing intended by Providence
for those poor and busy persons who had
little time to spend upon their toilettes, and
less money to devote to the accessories of the
dressing-table. She might indeed, so great
was her objection to all ordinary modes of
ablution, have been the original of that mother
who, when she left her daughters at school,
begged they should on no pretence be permitted
to wash their faces.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A silk handkerchief,” she suggested,
“carefully passed over the skin, being sufficient
for the purpose, and rendering injury to the
complexion impossible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And, indeed, at a time when “making up”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>was rather an art than a science, ere chemistry
had exhausted its resources to provide a new
bloom, and invention had outstripped imagination
in order to confer beauties previously
undreamed of, the indiscriminate use of so
plebeian a fluid as water could not fail to be
attended with accidents, not to say danger.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rule was then, as now, to improve
nature as much as possible, but the process by
which all this was accomplished seems to our
modern ideas clumsy and tedious.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is almost a pity that some of the great-grandmothers
of our present sirens who likewise,
and at great trouble and expense, tired
their heads and darkened their eyes and beautified
their complexions, cannot come to life
again and behold all the pretty inventions by
which much more effective and deceptive results
are now attained.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the steam-engine is to horse-power so
are the devices of women now to those employed
by their progenitors in the old days
departed. The worst of it is that beauty, by
reason of its universality, will soon be at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>discount. Time was when, unless a lady were
young and fair by the grace of God, she had
to be rich and idle before she could counterfeit
His gifts. Now loveliness can be had on
the most reasonable terms; a complexion is
cheaper than a chignon, and large eyes with
the iris distended at high noon can be matched
with real hair a dozen shades lighter than it
appeared a week previously, for the expenditure
of a few pence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Things were not so when Lady Glendare
came to Bayview, “for the benefit of the salt
water,” so ran the simple phrase in that primitive
age.</p>

<p class='c010'>People “took salt water” externally then
as they might have taken a solution of sulphuretted
hydrogen internally. Some strong-minded
old persons and some light-minded
young ones really liked the operation; but
taking society round, it shivered on the brink
and went in for its “three dips and out
again,” actuated either by a strong feeling of
duty or a stronger dread of being laughed at.
In a word, the sea was a medicine, and regarded
as such.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Lady Glendare considered it a medicine she
personally did not require, but she took it to
benefit her lord and spite her sister-in-law.
Many a wry face she made over the dose to
Grace; and Grace, when she beheld her ladyship
tripping down the ladder, pitied her, as
she might a poor wretch going up one on a
different errand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not but that sea-bathing at Bayview was,
as far as it could be made so, an eminently
comfortable affair. Grace was one of those
fanatics who dipped in season and out, for
whom rough weather had no terrors, winter
rather charms than otherwise, and her box was
therefore the perfection of a dressing-room by
the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The usual mode of procedure at Kingslough,
which indeed I have seen adopted in more
northern latitudes within the last few years,
and considered charmingly primitive and easy,
if slightly uncomfortable by reason of wind
and sand, was to undress on the shore, flinging
on a green or blue baize gown to conceal
the operation. Those who were so fortunate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>as to own “back entrances,” disrobed themselves
within four walls and slipped quietly
into the water, as, indeed, did others whose
houses faced the shore, and who, watching
their opportunity, rushed across the road enveloped
in cloaks, which they flung off at the
water’s edge, and then went out to sea as
calmly as though they had been fishes bred
and born.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps Lady Glendare was right, perhaps
the whole system might be accounted barbarous;
but it is open to question whether the
bathing-machine régime, which jolts a poor
shivering wretch over stones and shingles,
only to land her finally in six inches of water,
imagined sufficient to conceal her and her
meagre serge dress from profane eyes, is superior
in any way.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, there were no bathing-machines
at Kingslough then (it is possible Kingslough
may have adopted them now), and failing such
and such like devices, the Countess of Glendare
was fain to put up with the accommodation
afforded by Miss Moffat’s box.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>For many reasons Miss Moffat took her
pleasure in the deep at other hours than those
affected by the countess. Right glad would
her ladyship have been of her company in
the  water; but Grace judged, and judged
rightly, that on those mysteries of the toilette
which were enacted with closed doors and in
solemn silence, the scrutiny of youthful eyes
was not desired.</p>

<p class='c010'>Any change in the arrangement of her ladyship’s
hair was hidden, as she stepped out of
the box, by that most hideous of all head-gear,
an oil-silk bathing-cap; and if, in the
momentary glance which was all that even by
accident Grace caught of her guest’s face as,
followed by her maid, she went to perform her
penance, it looked older and whiter than had
been the case an hour previously, still that
proved nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her ladyship had been a beauty, and was
beautiful even yet. If she chose to put back
the years and look younger than chanced to be
actually the case, that was entirely her affair,
and Grace had sense enough to know the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>countess felt no desire to reveal the secret
means whereby such wonderful results were
obtained.</p>

<p class='c010'>As regarded the maid, she consented to
bathe, as she would have consented to anything
else which was duly considered in her
wages.</p>

<p class='c010'>After all, going into the sea could not by
any stretch of the imagination be considered a
greater hardship than coming to Ireland.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ireland was an extra, and so was bathing,
or, to speak more correctly, following Lady
Glendare into the water and assisting her to
bathe. Mrs. Somerford wondered how her
sister-in-law could think of making such an
exhibition of herself; but the exhibition was
rapidly restoring the earl’s popularity. Her
ladyship’s condescension—so the fact of her
going into the sea at all was styled—had given
a greater fillip to Kingslough than could have
been supposed likely. The Ardmornes had
tried being popular, but Lady Glendare beat
them at their own game, and the finishing
stroke of being within an ace of drowning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>settled, as Grace prophesied it would, the fate
of the Tory candidate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Certainly, could Kingslough have chosen, it
would not have selected Mr. Brady for her
ladyship’s rescuer.</p>

<p class='c010'>It grudged such a piece of good fortune to a
man of his standing and antecedents; but
still, had he not chanced to be at hand when
the countess got out of her depth, and her
maid lost whatever presence of mind she ever
possessed, and stood shrieking helplessly,
while Grace ran the risk of being carried out
to sea likewise in her mad endeavour to render
assistance,—had Mr. Brady, I say, not been
near enough to render efficient help then,
Kingslough would have lost both Miss Moffat
and the stranger within her gates. And
Kingslough was not ungrateful; more especially
as the earl, moved no doubt by hints
from his agent, and very plain speaking on
the part of Mr. Robert Somerford, confined
his thanks, so far as anybody knew, to an
early visit.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nettie and her husband were not taken into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>high favour at Rosemont. They were, it is
true, like everybody else, asked to the election
ball, but Mr. and Mrs. Brady had sense
enough to stay away.</p>

<p class='c010'>The world did not know that a grateful
husband had asked in which direction Mr.
Brady’s wishes lay, so that he might advance
them, and that Lady Glendare had told Nettie
she could answer for herself and her children
that they would never, never forget the obligation
under which Mr. Brady had laid them.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were a great many things Mr. Brady
wanted which it was in Lord Glendare’s
power to give; but although he knew enough
of society to be aware a nobleman’s memory
for benefits conferred is about as short as that
of other people, he contented himself, for the
time being, with having “got his foot in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It might be or it might not be that hereafter
the earl would have the opportunity of
serving him disinterestedly, but he was well
aware that once he was in a position to avail
himself of his opportunities, he could make it
serve Lord Glendare’s purpose to advance his
views.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>The world was before him—and it was an
advantage that his world now included an acquaintance
with the owner of Rosemont, and
something which amounted almost to the
right of speaking or writing to him without
the intervention of any one, whether agent or
lawyer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Brady hated lawyers, which was all the
more natural since lawyers, even his own,
hated him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Looking around, this man saw that nearly
every rising fortune, and almost every fortune
that was secure in Kingslough, owed its foundation
to some stone rent from the ruins of
the Glendare prosperity. Any one whose property
was unencumbered—any one who was
getting on in the world, any one whose
father and grandfather having been nobodies
was consequently educating his children to
become somebodies, owed the whole of their
advancement to the need or the improvidence
of the Glendares.</p>

<p class='c010'>Any man clever enough to obtain their ear,
and patient enough to wait his opportunity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>any one unscrupulous as to making terms,
and wise enough to have those terms made
binding, could get an advantage over the
Somerfords, could clear his own way to
wealth, while lending a hand to help them
along the road to ruin.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not that they needed any help; they found
the road easy to travel, if occasionally not
over pleasant.</p>

<p class='c010'>To use a phrase which has become common
of late in connexion with business failures,
“They were bound to go;” and to pursue the
same simile, all that wise men thought of in
relation to them was how to get as much
money, or money value, as possible out of
them before the crash came.</p>

<p class='c010'>Unsophisticated people, who had always
been hearing of the embarrassments of each
successive earl, thought there must be a wonderful
vitality about the Somerfords’ affairs,
and concluded rashly, that what had been
apparently from the beginning must go on to
the end; but these were persons who forgot,
on the one hand, the first enormous extent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the property, and, on the other, the fact that a
man rolling down hill gains a frantic speed
as he nears the bottom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not know why I should grudge
Glendare this triumph,” said Lord Ardmorne,
looking askance at grapes which he would
fain have made believe to think sour; “he
will never see his nominee sent to Parliament
again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And the marquis was right. When the
next election took place Mr. Robert Somerford,
who contested the seat himself, was beaten,
not ignominiously, perhaps, but sufficiently.</p>

<p class='c010'>From which remark of his fellow-peer, it
will be understood that the earl had the happiness
of seeing a Whig returned for the
family seat. The fight was fierce, the contest
close, the expense great, but the Glendare
interest won.</p>

<p class='c010'>How far my lady contributed to this result
can only be surmised; how far sympathy
carried the voters is also problematical. One
thing only is certain, that when the general
public learned how Lady Glendare, herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>still ailing, started at a few hours’ notice to
see her youngest born, reported dangerously
ill, and heard Lord Glendare making his
lament about Arthur, whom he loved best of
all his children, and called, to those who
evinced sorrow (and few there were that failed
to do so), the “flower of the flock;” and
when further news came that on the very eve
of the election the earl was summoned away,
told to travel with all speed “if he wished to
see his boy alive,” the hearts of the people
forgot Th’ Airl’s faults, and remembered only
Th’ Airl’s grief.</p>

<p class='c010'>Men who had “promised,” men who had
half consented, men who were undecided,
forgot their promises, their semi-agreement,
their doubts, and voted to please the earl.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the result did please him. Though
his son lay dead when the news came, he felt
gratified, and, for the moment it might be, so
far as such a sensation could exist in a Glendare,
grateful.</p>

<p class='c010'>After all, they were not a bad race, a degenerate
peasantry, those Irishmen, who despite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Lord Ardmorne’s money remained true
to the Somerfords and the traditions of their
fathers.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were a staunch tenantry and an honest,
who forgot not former benefits—so he mentally
styled the renewals of leases, the granting
of liberty to pay rent—those sturdy independent
men who spoke to him as though he
had been one of themselves, and yet who
honoured him and his house, who toiled early
and late to make up the amount required on
“gale” days, expressive phrase! and who
asked for nothing better than to live and die
hard-working paupers on the ground their
“forbears” had, personally paupers likewise,
cultivated for the benefit of a reckless, faithless,
ingrate, doomed race.</p>

<p class='c010'>Doomed! yes, and justly. They had cumbered
the ground for a sufficient period, and
the inexorable fiat, “Cut them down!” had
gone forth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their reign was coming to an end—the
reign of the good-natured, handsome, wicked
Glendares. They had sprung from the loins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of some dare-devil English trooper, and they
had not belied their ancestry. It was time
for them to depart and give place to another
house willing to return to the soil a portion at
all events of what it took out of the soil.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Glendares, one and all, men and
women, were as those in the days of Noë.</p>

<p class='c010'>They ate, they drank, they married, they
were given in marriage, and still the waters
were creeping up about them, round and
about, and when they were engulfed no soul
pitied them.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was coming, it was coming; wise were
they who could read the signs of the sky, and
foretell the impending tempest, wise in their
generation, as are usually the children of this
world.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the wise men were Mr. Dillwyn
and Nettie’s husband. Of the doings of the
former there will be something to state hereafter.
He took steps at which all the world
wondered, but which at the same time all men
could see and comment upon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Brady, on the contrary, worked like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>mole underground, throwing up here a mound
and there another, that might have conveyed
a hint to observant eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the eyes were wanting. Society at
Kingslough was not clever at addition. Scandal,
being presumably feminine, is generally
deficient in its ability to solve abstruse arithmetical
problems.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kingslough, therefore, with whom Mr.
Brady did not intermeddle, put Mr. Brady on
one side and left him at leisure to work out
his plans.</p>

<p class='c010'>What those plans were, even Nettie, with
all her quick perception and intuitive knowledge
of other folks’ designs, failed fully to
understand. She comprehended that her husband,
like the rest of his countrymen, had a
passion for the possession of land, a passion
not second even to his love of money; but her
imagination never grasped the fact that already
he had formed a scheme to get the Woodbrook
mortgage into his own hands, and the thing
he most fervently hoped for was that he might
be able to achieve his purpose before the
General died.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The idea had entered his mind, more in the
form of a vague wish than a practicable
scheme, on that day when John Riley and his
father refused his proffered hand; but he had
since brooded over the plan, moulded it into
shape, and resolved to carry it into effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>He knew he could ruin the Rileys. It became
in his mind a mere question of time, for
now that Miss Moffat had refused to cast in
her lot with the family, not even a hope remained
of ultimate extrication. The more
rapidly the world went on—and the world had
begun in those days to show signs of quicker
movement—the more certainly were the
Rileys doomed to destruction; but he felt
that his revenge would lose half its sweetness
if he failed to carry out his design in the
General’s lifetime.</p>

<p class='c010'>Already his fancy portrayed the old man
leaving the house and lands he had struggled
so gallantly and so unavailingly to retain.
Already he pictured the daughters governesses,
the father and mother living poorly in
some cheap house in Kingslough, the son’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>exertions being taxed to provide for the necessities
of his family.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such reverses had been over and over
again, such a reverse should be enacted once
more.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Had the Rileys,” he said to himself, but
said falsely, though perhaps unconscious of his
self-deceit, “had the Rileys recognized Nettie
and received me, I would have forgiven them
their insolence, and helped them to build up
their fortunes once again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So he said, so possibly he thought; but the
experience of all time tending to prove that a
known enemy is better than a false friend, the
Rileys, in the impulse of their indignation at
Nettie’s choice, acted probably as well for
themselves as they would have done had they
gone into a series of worldly calculations and
ordered their conduct accordingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Brady might be a rising man in a pecuniary
sense, people soon began to say he
was, but the Rileys were of one rank and sort
and he of another, and there can be no greater
folly than for one in a higher station to suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>that a person who is trying to creep up
to the same station will serve him faithfully
either for love or interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>So after John’s departure there was a dead
break between Woodbrook and Maryville,
and if Nettie had found her life in Kingslough
monotonous, she probably found it—except
so far as her husband’s tempers diversified
the routine—more monotonous still in
her new home.</p>

<p class='c010'>But how she fared in that new home,
whether well or the reverse, no one could tell.
Few ever saw her, to none did she give her
confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even the Castle Farm beheld her no more.
In the early days of her marriage she wandered
over there two or three times, in the
vague hope, perhaps, of meeting Grace; but
Mr. Brady, hearing of these visits, expressed
his disapproval, and Nettie silently obeyed
his wishes in that as in all other matters.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps, indeed, after a few sentences she
and her husband exchanged one day, she felt
little inclination to listen to Mrs. Scott’s hopeful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>talk about the future, her cheerful gossip
concerning their plans and expectations.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder,” said Mr. Brady to his wife,
“why Scott is drawing all those stones? It
looks as if he meant to build.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So he does,” Nettie answered; “he is
going to build a new byre and stable and loft
over.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He must be mad,” remarked Mr. Brady,
“to lay out money at the tail-end of his
lease.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The earl has promised him a new one, did
not you know that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I heard something about it,” said her husband,
“but it is all nonsense. The earl has
no power to give him a new lease.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?” Nettie inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder if one could talk for three
minutes to any woman without her asking
‘Why?’” said Mr. Brady impatient. “It
would take me a day to explain the why and
the wherefore to you. He can’t, and there’s
an end of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Having returned which courteous answer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Mr. Brady walked out of the room with his
hands deep in his pockets.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now the lands of the Castle Farm “marched,”
to use a local expression, with those of Maryville.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='large'>SEVEN YEARS AFTER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>High noon once again at Kingslough; high
noon, with a leaden sky, a drizzling rain
falling, the streets ankle deep in mud, the
side paths sloppy and dirty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Altogether a miserable noon—the sea out
a long way, as was its wont to go at Kingslough
when low tide-time came; an expanse
of grey, sad-looking shore; the water still
and sullen; the hills the only bit of colour
in the landscape, for the foliage of the fir-trees
in the distant woods looked almost black
by contrast with the leafless branches amongst
which they reared their heads.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>No sunlight dancing on the waves; no
shifting shadows succeeded by bright patches
of brightness coming and going upon the
uplands; no mellow haze softening the distance;
no purple bloom softening the scene
into a dream of fairyland. At the foot of
its hills, Kingslough lay crouching and
shivering its houses together; houses in
which every blind in the lower windows
was drawn close, or the shutters closed, in
token of—respect, the people would have
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let the word go for what it was worth.
It could not now matter to Lord Glendare—in
evidence of whose death the weather itself
seemed to have put on mourning—whether
the men he had ground down into the earth
loved or hated, respected or despised, his
memory.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was gone—by the road winding inland,
along the Glendare Parade—closely-shut
houses on one side, and the dark, bare shore,
with the leaden-coloured sea reflecting a
leaden sky, on the other—up the steep hillside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>they were about to bear the mortal
remains of the earl to their last earthly home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nearly seven years had passed since his
previous visit to Ireland, and during that time
progress set a weak, uncertain foot, even in
Kingslough.</p>

<p class='c010'>Men had arisen who, from first whispering
doubts of the Glendare infallibility, gradually
grew bolder, and at length openly
proclaimed the new doctrine, that property
has its duties, and that the human being, be
he of gentle birth or of simple, to whom many
talents have been given, must account some
day for the use made of those talents, if not
at any human tribunal, before the throne of
God.</p>

<p class='c010'>To those who had been accustomed to regard
themselves as relieved from all responsibility
by the act of God Himself; who
believed in the divine right of landlords to
do what they liked with their own; who had
never regarded the people save as so much
raw material, out of which rent and renewal
fines were to be extracted—easily and kindly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>if possible—with difficulty and harshness
should necessity arise; to those, in a word,
who, like the Glendares, had been living on the
edge of a social precipice, the increasing murmurs
of discontent fell on their ears as a sound
of impossible, yet uncomfortable, prophecy.</p>

<p class='c010'>They had been Glendares since the time
of that careless, selfish English trooper; they
had been great people; they had lived on the
fat of the land; they had ruffled it with the
best; the fairest women had smiled upon
them; men of rank equal to their own, of
better birth, of stricter principles, had condoned
the faults and sins of their false, bad
race, for the sake of the charms of person and
the grace of manner which distinguished all
of the name; and could it be—could it that
an end was to come to the pleasant vices
paid for by the sweat of toiling peasants, the
prematurely old faces of anxious wives, the
feeble though willing work of little children,
who were turned out of their cradles into the
fields to help to make up the rent?</p>

<p class='c010'>Had noon come and gone, and were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>evening shadows already darkening the fair
landscape? Was the day in which their
fellows greeted them with smiles, and paid
them honour, drawing to an end, and a night,
dark and starless, closing in around a House
which had ruled despotically for so long and
so ill.</p>

<p class='c010'>As is usual, the signs of the times were
first made apparent in increased difficulties of
obtaining money or credit. So to speak, the
murmurs of dissatisfaction grew into words,
which could be distinguished by the ears of
the earl, if by no other members of the
family.</p>

<p class='c010'>Never had a Glendare been so deeply involved
in debt as he; never had a Glendare
been so short of that which should enable
him to clear his debts, even temporarily.
One generation had gone on pushing its
burdens on the next. Long leases, sometimes
for nine hundred and ninety-nine years, had
been granted by successive proprietors at
disastrously small rents, for the sake of a
“lump sum down,” which sum vanished like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“snow off a dyke.” Lands had been sold,
rights conceded. Almost everything available
with which the Glendares could part
had been leased or sold or mortgaged.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fortunes were being made out of streams,
moors, building-sites, houses, and farms the
Glendares had parted with, under the pressure
of importunate creditors, for an old song.</p>

<p class='c010'>No young sprig of nobility ever made
worse bargains with professed money-lenders
than successive earls with men who were wise
enough to take advantage of the Somerford
necessities. Agent after agent had fattened
on the spoil; some of them, catching the infection
of their betters, spent their money recklessly,
and came again, or their families after
them, to indigence. Some went to England
and did well there; others, again, bought
properties in distant parts of Ireland, and
set up in the land-owning business for themselves;
all, at any rate—however they spent
their money—had a pull out of the Glendare
purse, as the state of the Glendare purse could
testify.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The mismanagement, the profuse expenditure,
the eating the calf before birth, the depredations
of outsiders, had continued for a
long time, but it was impossible the game
could be carried on for ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>The end was coming; the murmurs of a
once voiceless people, rising at length into a
hoarse low cry of discontent, reached even to
London, and, together with the remonstrances
of lawyers and agents and the demands and
entreaties of duns, told the earl that, unless
he and his reformed their ways, reduced their
outgoings and came down a little from their
high estate, they would have to sink altogether
and drop a title and a rank they had
no longer wealth to maintain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is hard upon me in my old age,” said
the earl to himself with that self-pity which
would be ludicrous were it not almost pathetic,
which those who have never showed pity to
others always extend to themselves—“old,
broken, weighed down by trouble, with one
foot in the grave”—but here the soliloquy
ended. The ideas it expressed seemed too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>true to form pleasant food even for self-pity.
The years “few and evil” were drawing to
a close, and the prospect of having both feet
laid in the grave was as little agreeable to
his lordship as it proves to most of those who
have loved this world, its sins, its pomps, and
its pleasures passing well.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It all began when Arthur went,” he said
one day to Lady Glendare; and certainly, since
the death of his favourite son, trouble and the
earl had not walked on different sides of life’s
highway. Petty annoyances, grave anxieties,
family trials, succeeded each other as though
all were part of a giant army gathered to annihilate
an enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Save Henry—the heir—he was childless,
and one of his sons had before his departure,
dragged even the Glendare name through
such disreputable places that the world could
scarcely put on a show of decent sympathy
with his parents when his career was cut
short.</p>

<p class='c010'>Henry the earl did not love—or loved, to
speak more correctly, after the fashion in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>which men usually love those who are born
to wear their shoes after them—and Henry
had not much affection to spare for his father.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless, he had been ready enough to
join him in granting leases, and cutting off
part of the entail, until he discovered that far
more than the lion’s portion of the spoil was
finding its way into the earl’s pocket.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some one enlightened that overwise young
man on this point; my lady declared the
some one was Robert Somerford, whom she now
hated with that impotent hatred only a weak
vain woman can entertain towards a man who,
through the deaths of her children, stands
a few feet nearer rank and wealth; and the
result was, that the next time the earl asked
his son to join him in some fresh work of
destruction, his son flatly refused to do anything
of the kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There has been enough of this suicidal
policy in the family already,” said the young
man with an air of withering superiority,
“and I for one will be no party to its continuance.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“But, Henry, you are as much in want of
money as I am, and I only ask you to do
for and with me what I did for my father,”
urged the earl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What you may have chosen to do for
your father is beside the question,” was the
reply. “I have quite made up my mind as to
the course I intend to take. It is true I
am in want of money, but, on the whole, I
find the Jews cheaper than your lordship”—</p>

<p class='c010'>Whereupon his lordship ordered him to
leave the house, and there being reasons why
London was at that time not so agreeable a
residence as it might have have been to the
future earl, he went to visit his relatives at
Rosemont—</p>

<p class='c010'>Who now consisted, by marriage and otherwise,
of Mr. Robert Somerford, Mrs. Somerford
translated into Mrs. Dillwyn, and her
husband, Mr. Dillwyn.</p>

<p class='c010'>The news of the proposed matrimonial
alliance had electrified Kingslough six
years previously. That Mr. Dillwyn should
propose! that Mrs. Somerford should consent!—so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the sentences of wonderment ran,
while gossips lifted their hands—whilst ladies
eligible as to spinsterhood, though not equally
so as to age, wondered what the agent could
be thinking about to marry a woman older
than himself, and she a widow—whilst men
shook their heads and said, “Dillwyn was
not born yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What will the earl do under the circumstances?”
people inquired—meaning, Would
the earl dismiss his agent, or receive him into
the bosom of the Glendare family? would he
give the bride-elect notice to leave Rosemont,
or would he ask her and the bridegroom to
spend part of the honeymoon in London?</p>

<p class='c010'>Popular opinion inclined to the belief that
Mr. Dillwyn would have to leave his situation
and deliver up his papers, and had Lady
Glendare’s wishes been followed, a line hard
and fast had then been drawn between the
earl and the occupants of Rosemont; but
her wishes were not followed, and not only
was Mrs. Somerford allowed to remain at
Rosemont, but Mr. Dillwyn was permitted
to take up his abode there with her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>He offered to pay a rent for the mansion
and grounds, and, to his secret satisfaction,
Lord Glendare accepted his offer. When
Henry Lord Trevor came of age, almost one
of his first acts was, with his father, to
grant a long lease of Rosemont to the agent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But remember, Dillwyn, Rosemont is still
to be our home when we come to Ireland,”
said the earl; and Mr. Dillwyn agreed, nothing
loth.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had counted the cost of his plan before
carrying it into practice, and the cost included
maintaining his noble relatives on the few
occasions they might choose to honour Ireland
with their company.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for Mr. Robert Somerford, he did not
like Mr. Dillwyn, but he did not dislike the
match. It gave him a much more comfortable
home than had hitherto fallen to his lot,
money in his purse, power to travel, and, to a
certain extent, maintain his proper position
in the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were pecuniary ease and comparative
affluence amongst the trio who lived there.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Mr. Dillwyn was well to do, and carefully
trying to be better, but he acted towards his
stepson with a liberality which at last elicited
some astonished, if not grateful, remark from
the younger man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not right you should be mewed up
in a remote country house through the best
years of your life,” answered Mr. Dillwyn;
“you ought to see the world, and become
fitted for a position beyond that of a mere
dependant. It is on the cards you may one
day be Earl of Glendare yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With an amazement too swift and genuine
to be assumed, Mr. Somerford, looking eagerly
in the agent’s face, asked him what he meant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Precisely what I say,” answered Mr.
Dillwyn. “Count your chances, and see
what stands between you and the title.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a pause; then Mr. Somerford,
having presumably counted the chances and
found them in his favour, said,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“You calculated on this when you married
my mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did, Mr. Somerford,” was the reply, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>calmly uttered as though there had been no
sting contained in the sentence, no scorn in
the tone. “A man must marry for something—love,
money, interest. Your mother married
me because she was sick of existing on
her wretched pittance of a jointure, because
she believed I might assist you. I married
her because I had reasons to believe you
might one day be able to serve me; because I
knew the match must strengthen my position
with the earl. There was no question of love
in the matter, no pretence of anything beyond
respect;” and Mr. Dillwyn stopped, thinking
evidently his stepson ought to be perfectly
satisfied with the explanation vouchsafed.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Mr. Somerford’s vanity had received a
blow which a much longer and more plausible
explanation might have failed to soothe.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had thought, honestly and sincerely,
that the honour of an alliance with a member
of his family was more than an equivalent for
Mr. Dillwyn’s good looks, comparative youth,
unquestionable ability, and wealth acquired—no
one exactly understood how; and now to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>be told that, instead of an open, the man had
been playing an underhand, game—with himself
as probable ace of trumps hidden up his
sleeve all the time—was more than he could
endure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So that was your motive?” he began
quietly, drawing in his breath at the end of
his sentence, as the wind lulls for a moment
before the storm breaks forth in its fury.</p>

<p class='c010'>With all their amiability the Somerfords
had tempers, and knew on occasions how to
exhibit them; and the years spent in association
with the family had not been passed by
Mr. Dillwyn altogether in vain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, at any rate, he understood what the
lowering of Mr. Robert’s voice and the compression
of his lips portended, and so hastened
to avert the threatened hurricane.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have shown you my hand,” he began.
“Do not let us quarrel about the honours I
hold till we are quite sure they will win.
Do not speak that which is in your mind unless
you are satisfied it will be to your interest to
quarrel with me. I tell you it is your interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>to keep me as your friend. If the Glendare
estates, or any part of them, are to be saved,
which is problematical, I am the only person
who can tell you how to save them. If without
the estates you are ever to keep your head
above water, I am the only person able to show
you the way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ought to be the last person to question
your ability to compass anything on which
you set your mind,” said Mr. Somerford, “but
I do not feel at all disposed to allow you to
exercise your talents in the management of
my affairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you have affairs to manage, it will
be time enough to discuss that question,”
retorted the agent. “Meanwhile, if I did
make a throw for fortune and position, remember
what I staked upon it. I burdened myself—I
use the word advisedly, Robert—with
a young man utterly destitute, with a lady
worthy of all esteem, but no longer even in
the prime of middle life, while between you
and the possibility of the title stood how
many? The Glendares, I believe, always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>expect people to give them something for
nothing; to waste their health, strength,
money, in the unselfish desire to give them
pleasure; but if you have taken up any false
ideas of that kind with regard to me, disabuse
your mind of it as fast as you can. It is of no
use scowling. I will work with you or
against you; only say whether we are to be
friends or foes, and I will order my course
accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are wondrous plain, sir, all of a sudden,”
said Mr. Somerford with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am wondrous true, considering the nature
of the man to whom I am speaking,” replied
Mr. Dillwyn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no necessity for you to favour
me with an analysis of my character,” returned
the younger man; “I think we understand
each other without going into particulars.
It seems we must row together, or swim
separate. Is not that the English of the confidence
you have forced upon me? Yes; well,
that being the case, and having no taste for
salt water, I agree to let bygones be bygones,
and take my chance with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Meaning that we are to be friends?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you attach any importance to the expression,
yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you give me your hand upon it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Having given my word, I should have
imagined the other form unnecessary; but as
you wish——” and he held out his hand,
which Mr. Dillwyn clasped hard for a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he loosed it, saying, “That is a
bargain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Agreed,” answered Mr. Somerford carelessly;
and he went off, humming an opera
air.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would not give much for my hopes if
you were once king,” muttered the agent, as
he watched his retreating figure. “Drivelling
idiots all—cruel, selfish, vain, inconsequent
fools—earl, heir, nephew. What could his
mother have been thinking of when she
brought such a short-sighted simpleton into a
world already overweighted with simpletons?
Well, forewarned forearmed, and when it
comes to a stand-up fight between us we shall
see which man has best made ready for battle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>He has gone to Bayview I suppose. Ah,
Grace! you had better have taken me. Even
if he comes to be earl, you will find a coronet
cannot compensate for the want of both head
and heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Whereby hung a tale—one never enlarged
upon by Grace Moffat. After she refused
her first lover, she never took man, woman,
or child into her full confidence about those
who came after.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was to this united household Henry Lord
Trevor, after the unpleasantness with his
father, came. Sympathy in abundance he received
from all the inmates of Rosemont, to
say nothing of that which he valued far more
than sympathy—a considerable pecuniary advance
from Mr. Dillwyn, who, playing in those
days for high stakes, could not afford to be
over-cautious in his game.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the whole, the heir-apparent did not
dislike Ireland; the almost fulsome affection
displayed by the tenantry, who, growing
weary of the old <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i>, trusted that the
“young lord, bless him!” would reduce their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>rents, and find money for improvements, was
not unpleasant to one of a family to whom
popularity was as the sunshine and the breeze
to mankind in general.</p>

<p class='c010'>He would not have been a Glendare had he
not promised liberally, and thus he charmed
the people and they pleased him. A better
shot than his cousin—a more indefatigable
sportsman—he traversed the moors and walked
over the hills in search of game. All in vain,
knowing what he knew, Mr. Dillwyn tried to
keep him within bounds (the life of this young
man had suddenly become precious in his
eyes); he would not be staid; and so, with
the seeds of a fatal disease lying in his frame,
he exposed himself to rain and storm, and
trudged miles through mists that were as the
very breath of death to a constitution such as
his.</p>

<p class='c010'>By Mr. Dillwyn’s advice the breach with
Lord Glendare was closed. At his dictation
the heir wrote a letter of apology for the expressions
of which he had made use. After
stating how deeply he regretted having permitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>temper to overcome his filial respect, he
proceeded to say that, whilst his views concerning
the general impolicy of granting long
leases at nominal rents for the sake of raising
amounts utterly nonequivalent to the benefits
conferred, remained unaltered, still, if any
plan were thought of by which his father’s
difficulties could be permanently lessened, he
would do all in his power to assist in carrying
it into effect. “For myself,” he went on, “I
have already experienced so much of the ill
effects of running into debt, that I feel as
though I could make any sacrifice to set our
affairs straight. I should not object even to
take up my residence permanently in Ireland—(he
had been a week in the country, and
game was plentiful)—if it were thought desirable
for me to do so. Dillwyn believes a
considerable amount might be raised by granting
leases for a certain term to those of the
tenants who hold their land on lives. There
has been such a mortality amongst the members
of our family lately, that a feeling of uneasiness
is abroad, and it seems probable that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>even those persons to whom fresh leases of
this description have been granted since I
came of age would willingly pay a further
sum to have their tenancy placed upon a more
secure footing. I may mention one case in
illustration of this. Since I arrived here, Mr.
Brady, to whom you may recollect we granted
a lease of the Castle Farm, Scott’s tenancy of
which expires at the death of Lady Jane
Somerford, has called to say he is prepared to
pay any amount Dillwyn may consider fair, if
we will change the lease from three lives to
ninety-nine years. Evidently he does not
think our space of existence likely to extend
to the same term as that of her ladyship.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The last sentence was not, it is unnecessary
to say, prompted by Mr. Dillwyn. He was
not given to sentimentality; nevertheless a
grave pity darkened his eyes as the young man
laughingly read it aloud.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Old ladies have a wonderful knack of living,”
he went on. “Now there is that Miss
Riley; she must have been a hundred, twenty
years ago.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“I do not know her age,” Mr. Dillwyn
answered; “but Lady Jane Somerford was
ninety-six last June. She has had her share
of the Glendare revenues, no matter who else
may have gone short.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder who invented life-leases,” remarked
the other thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some one who liked speculating himself,
and understood the love for speculation, which
is an integral part of human nature.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But our tenants’ human nature appears
eminently non-speculative,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As the world grows older, its inhabitants
get wiser,” said Mr. Dillwyn. He could have
told his auditor that there would be little of a
speculative character in taking a lease on his
life, at all events! but the agent’s rule had
always been to try to make things pleasant,
and he was not going to deviate from it now.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He may live; who knows?” reflected
Mr. Dillwyn; “in a warm climate he might
last for years; but, whether he live or die, if
only the earl agree to my scheme Mr. Robert
will find he had better not have tried to play
a double game with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>From which remark it will be seen that the
agent’s Christianity did not extend so far as
the forgiveness of injuries inflicted or contemplated.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for the earl, he was only too happy to
accept the olive-branch held out by his son;
and as the course suggested by Mr. Dillwyn
offered a chance of raising some money, he
came over to Ireland in person to carry it with
greater expedition into effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>Glad enough was he to leave London and
its duns behind him for a season, and, crouching
over the library fire at Rosemont, a bent
and broken man, he assured Mr. Dillwyn, even
with tears, that if any arrangement could be
made which might enable him to end his days
in peace, he would live anywhere—he would
do anything—he would induce her ladyship
to do anything for the sake of obtaining peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It has been all wrong from beginning to
end,” he declared, with a frankness characteristic
of those who, having eaten up the whole
of their cake at once, lament the absence of
any hoard from which another may be obtained.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“It has been all a mistake. I ought to have
retrenched years ago; I ought to have come
here, or lived abroad. Take warning by me,
Henry, and remember that an extravagant
youth means a miserable old age. Life seemed
very happy once—ah! that was a long, long
time ago. If I could but have the past to
spend over again, with my present experience——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You would make just as bad a business
of your second existence as you have done of
your first,” thought Mr. Dillwyn, while he
publicly observed “that regrets were worse
than useless; that what they had now to consider
was, how to surmount present difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the way,” he went on, “speaking of
difficulties, there seems to be one with Scott
of the Castle Farm. He says your lordship
promised him a renewal of his lease, and that
he has spent a mint of money on the place in
consequence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Castle Farm! where is it? what is
it?” exclaimed the earl pettishly. “I wish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Dillwyn, you would not pester me about
matters that lie exclusively in your province.
I promise the man a lease? why should I?
And, even if I had, he must have been an
idiot to lay out money until he got it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he says he gave your lordship money
for granting it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, what nonsense all this is!” cried
the earl angrily. “I don’t know where the
Castle Farm is. I should not know the man
Scott if I met him to-morrow. Why should
he bring money to me instead of paying it to
you? What have I ever had to do with the
tenants, except at election times?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is the point,” persisted Mr. Dillwyn.
“He declares he paid you the money when
you were over at the time of the last election,
and that, therefore, Mr. Brady’s lease is
invalid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He must be a fool,” observed the earl in a
tone of sincere conviction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I told him,” was Mr. Dillwyn’s reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has no lease, has he?” asked the
earl.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“None excepting that which expires with
the life of Lady Jane Somerford.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then what does the fellow mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That I really cannot say,” answered the
agent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, it is all a trumped-up story,”
said Lord Somerford.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very possibly,” agreed Mr. Dillwyn, and
the subject dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next day, when Amos Scott called at the
agent’s office, that gentleman said to him,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, look here, Scott—you chose to deal
with the earl direct before, and you must
settle this matter with him now. I wash my
hands of it. I don’t understand the transaction,
and I don’t want to understand it. The
earl will be up to his ears in business for a
few days, but go to Rosemont, say the early
part of next week, and ask to see Lord Trevor.
I will beg him to get you speech of his
father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yer honour’s a hard man, but I thought
you would have seen justice done to me,” said
Amos bitterly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“I cannot do you justice. I tell you I know
no more of the matter than the babe unborn.
I will undertake that the earl shall see you;
anything more is beyond my power. However
it may be, you have not much cause of
complaint; Lady Jane has lived twenty-six
years longer than the time she ought, and you
have had the benefit of her toughness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No thanks either to you or my lord,”
answered Amos Scott with a grim smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks to Providence, who, it is said
takes an especial care of fools,” retorted Mr.
Dillwyn. “Come up on Tuesday morning
about ten o’clock. I will speak to Lord
Trevor to-night; that is all I can do for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Man proposes, but he cannot dispose. Amos
Scott never “had speech” of Louis Lord
Glendare, who, before Tuesday came, was
lying at Rosemont ill unto death, dying as
fast as he knew how.</p>

<p class='c010'>Physicians came from Dublin; my lady was
summoned in all speed from London: but the
first said there was “no hope,” and the
presence of the latter failed to save.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>For nearly a fortnight my lord lay unconscious
of debt, writs, duns, bailiffs—lay forgetful
of his wasted life—of the good he had
neglected to do—of the evil he had not failed
to perform.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a moment—only for a moment—at the
very last, the light flickered up again.</p>

<p class='c010'>His son noticed the change, and leaned
eagerly forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Arthur,” murmured the dying man, thinking
of the dead; and that was all—he was
Earl of Glendare no more. His son had succeeded
to the title.</p>

<p class='c010'>Following fast on the heels of the physicians
came a Dublin undertaker. No expense was
to be spared about the funeral; such were the
new earl’s orders.</p>

<p class='c010'>For eight whole days, which seemed to the
ordinary Irish mind a period almost disreputable,
the late earl lay sleeping his last sleep
in the home of his ancestors—sleeping so
quietly that he might well have dispensed with
the watchers, who never left his side by day
or by night.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>At length the ninth day arrived, that on
which he was to be borne to Ballyknock Abbey,
when, after the lapse of years, the reader is
asked once again to enter Kingslough at high
noon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The town is in mourning; the inhabitants,
with a hush of expectation on them, are waiting
to behold the spectacle of the “Th’ Airl”
being carried to his rest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='large'>THE LAST JOURNEY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Not even at election-time had the streets of
Kingslough and the roads leading into it been
so thronged as on the day of Lord Glendare’s
funeral.</p>

<p class='c010'>From ten, fifteen, and twenty miles people
came to see the sight. From far and near
they flocked into the town. Men, old and
young; comely women, with babies in their
arms; elderly women, so wrinkled and aged
that the memory of their childhood must have
seemed as a dream to them; girls straight and
handsome, with brilliant complexions and, as a
rule, light luxuriant hair came crowding in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>from the east, and north, and west. Some in
jaunting-cars, some in farm-carts, some on the
national low-backed car—in which the want of
springs was frequently counterbalanced by a
feather-bed covered with a patchwork counterpane
being laid on the body of the conveyance—most,
however, on foot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not every day does a nobleman go to his
rest, not every day was it given to Kingslough
to behold the proud spectacle of a hearse drawn
by six horses passing through its streets.</p>

<p class='c010'>Simple enough were the funerals the little
town witnessed as a rule. Quietly and unostentatiously
the dead were laid in their
graves. Little pomp and many followers,
such was the primitive fashion at Kingslough.
Amongst the poor, neighbour carried neighbour
to that resting-place he was helpless to
reach for himself. Amongst the rich, if the
distance to the churchyard were great, a hearse
was procured from Kilcurragh; but there the
black business began and ended. Friends and
relations followed in their own conveyances;
in broughams, chariots, barouches, phaetons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>dog-carts, gigs, cars, with an invariable rear of
foot-passengers.</p>

<p class='c010'>At that period of the world’s history a man
was not allowed to shirk out of the world unnoticed,
as if he had done something to be
ashamed of. So to speak, his friends accompanied
him to the very portals of earth, before
they could prevail on themselves to say farewell.
The worst fate which could befall a
human being was, when he went to the grave,
to do so without a “following;” but it did
not matter how unpretentious that following
chanced to be. A certain number of persons
had shown respect for the dead, that was
enough. There had been no apathy, no coldness,
no standing aloof. His friends had stuck
to him to the last. In driving sleet or blinding
snow no one worthy the name of friend
shrank from the performance of the final duty.
They followed if the roads were a foot deep in
mud, they stood beside the grave with the
rain beating down on their uncovered heads,
with the long, rank, wet grass reaching above
their ankles.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>No single mourning-coach preceded by a
hearse feathered as heavily as it might, would
have contented that sympathetic population.
Without a hearse at all it was possible for a
coffin to be carried to the grave; without a
coach it was possible to follow the coffin; but
it was a thing not to be thought of that any
one should be permitted to walk out of this
life as through a back-door, unmourned, unattended.</p>

<p class='c010'>And when this idea of companionship obtained
concerning even the poorest of the community,
how should sufficient honour be done
to the dead earl?</p>

<p class='c010'>How? the question was easy enough to
answer. It resolved itself into a matter of
multiplication. Where a commoner had fifties
the peer must have his thousands. In the
days to come, when the high-stepping horses,
and the sombre velvets, and the waving plumes
and all the undertaker’s bravery should be
forgotten, feeble old crones should still be able
to tell their grandchildren of the “grand burying,”
when the road from Rosemont to Kingslough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>was lined by spectators who, so soon as
the carriages and the horsemen, and the tenantry
had passed, became “followers” also; when
the ladies, dressed all of them in black, sat
at the windows where the blinds were drawn
half down, to view the sight; when the tenants
chosen for that purpose, all furnished by the
new earl with white linen hatbands, and white
gloves, “kept the curb,” so that the roadway
might be clear and unimpeded for the procession;
when all the shops were closed, and
the town was “like a Sunday;” when the
clergy of all denominations—and there were
many different sects in Kingslough—had white
scarves, ornamented by bows of the best black
ribbon, and black kid gloves sent to them;
when, for one appearance only, the lion lay
down with the lamb, and Father Kelly and
Mr. MacRoberts,—who disagreed as heartily
as it is possible for two Christians in name to
do, and this is saying enough—walked demurely
side by side; when happy was he or
she whose friends lived on the line of route;
when the halt, and the deaf, and the blind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>reaped a rich harvest, and, their pockets full
of halfpence, chanted the praises of the departed,
of the last Glendare who shall ever
sleep with his ancestors in the old abbey
situated so picturesquely on the height overlooking
the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was slow work traversing the weary miles
that stretched between Rosemont and Ballyknock
Abbey, and the Kingslough gentry had
ample time for luncheon before crowding to
the windows to look at the show.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the men, as a matter of course, were
either following the <i><span lang="fr">cortége</span></i> in carriages or
holding in their horses to a walking pace in
the rear of the carriages, but the ladies ate
their modest meal at their leisure, and discussed
many questions concerning the Glendares
over it.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the windows of Miss Riley’s house a
good view was to be obtained of the procession,
and from attic to parlour her rooms were
crammed by guests possessed of sufficient forethought
to take their mid-day repast with
them. As for Miss Riley—half blind, half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>deaf, whole childish—seated close by the window-frame,
she kept up an incessant wail for
Nettie. She had asked Nettie—why did she
not come? it would amuse Lillie to see the
show; why, if Nettie did not care for it herself,
should she deprive her little girl of the
pleasure? she had been a little girl once herself,
and a good girl too—before she was
naughty and ran away with Mr. Brady.</p>

<p class='c010'>Poor old lady! who would not rather die in
the summer’s prime than live on into the dull
December days, to babble idle stories to heedless
listeners? Who cared about the tale of
Nettie’s marriage now? who cared for Nettie
herself, or Mr. Brady, or Miss Riley? The
house was central, and commanded a good
view of the procession. Her older guests
hearkened to her civilly, if secretly impatient
of her doting utterances. The younger talked,
and whispered, and laughed, charmingly oblivious
of the fact that, if they lived long-enough,
age must come to them also—age
possibly even less attractive than that presented
by Miss Riley. But there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Nettie; at no window in Kingslough did that
most lovely face keep watch for the long, and
slow, and mournful funeral array.</p>

<p class='c010'>Contrary to all precedent, Mrs. Brady grew
fairer as she grew older.</p>

<p class='c010'>Possibly had all gone well with her—had
she married happily, and led the easy, contented
life it were devoutly to be wished all
women could lead—she might have grown
plump, and so lost her beauty.</p>

<p class='c010'>But as it was, the delicate carmine of her
cheeks had not deepened, the cheeks had
grown no rounder, the hair had darkened but
little, the figure was lithe and slight as ever.
She was the Nettie of old save for this, that
across her blue eyes there lay a dreamy shadow
which added to their tenderness, and that her
mouth, once almost childish in the pliability of
its muscles, had acquired an expression which
one who knew nothing of her story might
have failed to understand aright.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had suffered cruelly, she had made a
mistake, and some of the years during which
she must expiate her error were gone and past—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>few, only a few—but she was still so
young that grief seemed to touch her with a
remorseful pencil, and increased her loveliness
instead of destroying the one great gift God
had bestowed upon her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless, few now looked upon her winsome
face. On the rare occasions when she
was compelled to enter Kingslough, she walked
through it with veil drawn close, with hurried
steps, with eyes that looked neither to right
nor to left, that recognized and wished to
recognize no one who had known her in the
old days departed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not so, however, Mr. Brady; about Kingslough
he swaggered frequently, and time,
which works wonders, had brought him nods
and “how-d’ye-do’s” and “good mornings”
from men too idle, or too busy, or too careless
to interest themselves concerning the antecedents
of an apparently prosperous man.</p>

<p class='c010'>While Miss Riley moaned over Nettie’s absence,
he was solemnly amongst the other
mourners reining in a mare that for blackness
and uplifting of all her feet in protest of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>pace he forced her to adopt, might have done
credit to any undertaker in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>As it was, the earl’s funeral brought him a
good price for ‘Brunette.’ Common decency
forbade a deal during the tedious journey to
Kingslough, but human nature suggested a
series of remarks which led a certain Captain
Labucerbe to call next morning at Maryville
and offer a given sum for ‘Brunette,’ which,
after a becoming hesitation and reluctance,
Mr. Brady accepted.</p>

<p class='c010'>If, however, Nettie were nowhere to be seen,
her old companion Miss Moffat sat conspicuous
amongst the ladies who crowded the windows
of Major Perris’ house. Time had amply fulfilled
Mrs. Perris’ predictions concerning her
beauty. At four-and-twenty she was the most
lovely woman in all that part of the country.
The world of Kingslough had settled that she
was certain to marry Robert Somerford, as it
had settled years before she must marry John
Riley; but a girl possessed of her beauty and
her money had no lack of suitors, and if she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>were destined to wed the late earl’s nephew
she seemed also destined to refuse before doing
so as many would-be husbands as usually offer
themselves to the favourable consideration of
an heiress.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had it not indeed been for the fact of Mr.
Somerford’s constant visits at Bayview, Kingslough
might have decided that Grace bade
fair to become an old maid; but as matters
stood she was looked upon as almost engaged,
and treated by her friends accordingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her denials of the statement were treated
precisely then, as her denials of a similar
statement had been treated formerly. Kingslough
was convinced in its own mind that
whenever Mr. Somerford got “an appointment”
the marriage would take place; and
Kingslough also felt satisfied she would have
become a wife long previously but for her
father’s objection to her wedding a man who
had no money and no position. That Mr.
Moffat had never been asked either to consent
or refuse was too absurd an idea to entertain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course she was going to marry Robert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Somerford—so said Kingslough, and whatever
Kingslough said, it implicitly believed to be
true.</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly the hours crept by. On the road
conversation grew brisker; at the windows of
the Kingslough houses it flagged grievously;
in the streets people were getting very weary,
and not a few very drunk.</p>

<p class='c010'>The shutters of the public-houses were
closed, it is true, but the doors stood hospitably
open, and amongst the crowd of friends
and neighbours who thronged the streets there
were not wanting plenty of persons willing to
treat and wishful to be treated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless, even with the charm whisky
is capable of exercising, the masses were beginning
to get very tired. Everything about
the late earl and the new earl, and my lady,
and Mr. Robert and Mr. and Mrs. Dillwyn
that could be said had been said. Speculation
itself could advance nothing further concerning
the Glendare future, and the oldest
inhabitant could remember nothing about the
Glendare past which he had not already communicated.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>As for the ladies—the best regulated mind
could scarcely have considered the entertainment
provided that day particularly exhilarating.
Hostesses had committed the great mistake
of inviting their guests to come for
luncheon, and consequently, when luncheon
was over, and no sign of the funeral still
appeared, a feeling of boredom crept over even
the liveliest of the company.</p>

<p class='c010'>The occupation of mentally criticizing each
her neighbour’s apparel was denied on this
occasion. Every one appeared in black, and
as of course people could not be expected to
purchase a new dress for the occasion, a general
effect of second or third best attire prevailed,
which at once defied and disarmed comment.</p>

<p class='c010'>No Mrs. Hartley was there now in Kingslough
to excite or amuse the occupants of any
drawing-room by her plain speech and sharp
retorts. Long previously she had returned to
a country where, to quote her own observation,
“The poorest children are taught to pronounce
the letters in the alphabet properly.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“How do they pronounce H?” Grace wrote
back at once to inquire.</p>

<p class='c010'>In congenial society she rustled her silks—in
a civilized land she recalled the years spent
“amongst a warmhearted, barefooted, and prejudiced
race,” with something of the same
feeling as Dr. Livingstone, say, might evince
if he ever returned to converse familiarly concerning
the inhabitants of Central Africa. In
her descriptions of Irish ways, of Irish notions,
of Irish management, of Irish eccentricity, the
lady was merciless. The manners and customs
of the Isle of Saints were described to attentive
listeners with a <i><span lang="fr">verve</span></i> and bitterness for which
it seemed difficult to account, except on the
ground of intense dislike to the country and
the people; and in truth there had been a
“difference” between her and those of the
Irish over whom she exercised some authority,
a difference of so grievous a description, that
she sold all the land she owned to Lord Ardmorne,
and, shaking the dust of Ireland off her
feet, vowed a vow never to enter the country
again.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Had she remained in Kingslough, it is possible
the lives of Mrs. Brady and Grace might
have been different. As matters stood, both
her former favourites went on their separate
ways without forming a close friendship with
any woman, without considering it necessary
to establish confidential relations with any
adviser. There was no one now to talk reproachfully
to Grace about the honest heart
she had stabbed by her rejection of his love;
no one to show Nettie how to make the best
thing of an existence she had marred for herself
so young.</p>

<p class='c010'>The peace of mind of Kingslough, no longer
disturbed by the rich dress and bold utterances
of that strong-minded Englishwoman, who
had been so fond of golden-haired Nettie and
dark-haired Grace, of the girl with blue eyes
and the girl with grey, had attained a state of
tranquillity verging on dulness. But for the
sayings and doings of the democratic party,
there would literally have been no stock subject
of conversation amongst the <i><span lang="fr">élite</span></i> of Kingslough.
As it happened, however, just at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>time of Lord Glendare’s death, the malcontents
and those who, wishing to acquire notoriety,
self-elected themselves champions of the
people’s rights, had been making an unusual
disturbance. Meetings were held and speeches
delivered; the beauties of Ireland described,
and the soil, “blessed by heaven and cursed
by man,” invested with a number of qualities
subsequent experience has scarcely evolved
from it. Tom Moore was freely quoted, as
well as some of the extremely beautiful poetry
produced during the time of the Rebellion.
History was ransacked to furnish instances of
English cruelty and Irish chivalry. After
listening to the orations poured forth with all
the fervour, and unreason, and discursiveness
for which democratic orators have always been
noted, an uninformed auditor could only draw
one conclusion, namely, that there had never
been a great statesman, poet, patriot, soldier,
sailor, or writer born out of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c010'>With throbs of national pride the people
listened and believed, as name after name was
recited from what the speakers were pleased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>to style the “glory-roll of time.” With rejoicing
they gathered beside ingle nooks, and around
the turf fire of some wayside public-house,
to hear the schoolmaster or any other “scholard”
read out leaders in which the Whig paper of
the county spoke of the “oppressed tenants,”
of the “grinding tyranny” of the landlords,
of the right of the men who in the “sweat of
their brows tilled the soil to reap the fruit of
their labours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It would have been touching—had it not
been almost heart-breaking—to behold the
simple faith with which these utterances were
received. Now that men had “arisen to speak
for them,” the population felt satisfied the
future would be bright as the past had been
gloomy.</p>

<p class='c010'>That they were in danger of falling between
two stools never occurred to them; that old
friends might withdraw helping hands, that
new friends might be unable really to benefit
was too common sense a view of the matter to
present itself; that orators were all unconsciously
driving nails into the coffins of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>generation in order to benefit generations then
unborn, was a truth too self-evident to be
acknowledged by anybody. They believed
that in gaining fresh advantages, they should
lose none of the old; that in being independent
of the rich, they stood no danger of
losing the help and friendly feeling of the class
above them.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not much they really wanted, something
less than justice would have satisfied
every honest, sensible man in the community;
but a great deal more than justice would not
have contented the new brooms, who believed
society only wanted to be swept by them to be
made clean, who held the doctrine that the
only way to remodel old ways was to destroy
them, to encourage affection between all classes
in the community was to exterminate class
altogether, and to exemplify practically the
truth of the Irish theory that “one man is as
good as another—and better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In no community could social changes such
as these indicated, have passed altogether
unnoticed; and in a neighbourhood like Kingslough,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>where the upper ten bore an absurdly
small proportion to the lower thousand, much
conversation was induced by the evil doings
of the new prophets who had arisen to lead
the people to destruction.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even amongst ladies the topic proved one of
considerable interest, and much of the talk in
many houses on the day of Lord Glendare’s
funeral centred in the grievances, real or
fancied, of the lower orders.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for Miss Moffat, her sympathies were
with the people, but she had no toleration
for the demagogues who were deluding them.</p>

<p class='c010'>An earnest, quiet, patient friend of the
poor, she did not care to listen to foolish talk,
either about their wrongs or the way to right
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>With all the strength of her nature she
loved the hard-working, devoted, uncomplaining
men and women amongst whom she
had grown from a child to a woman, but well
she knew it was because of their unconsciousness
of fortitude, of endurance, of humble
heroism, that she had grown so fond of them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and she almost hated the orators who were
trying to change the very natures of those
they addressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same time she had seen too much of
the bitterness of the poverty against which
her humble friends waged incessant war; she
understood too well the struggle occupiers of
land had to get enough out of the soil to pay
their rent and keep soul and body together,
to endure with patience senseless remarks concerning
the discontent and ingratitude of poor
deluded creatures who flocked all too eagerly
to hear the tale of their wrongs and their trials
recounted with dangerous eloquence, with
declamation and exaggeration.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her heart was sore for the people. Had
she sprung from them, had she been of their
blood and their bone, her soul could not have
gone out to them in their sorrow and their
suffering more freely than proved the case.
She “spoke up for them,” and did no good
either to them or herself by her advocacy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you are older you will know better,”
said one antiquated lady, shaking her ancient
head with an air of solemn wisdom.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“The whole matter,” broke in a lively little
matron, “puts me in mind of that story which
tells how a client, who suddenly burst into
tears whilst his counsel was speaking, being
asked why he cried, answered ‘I never knew
how much I had lost until now;’ and in
like manner the peasantry never knew they
were oppressed and injured till Mr. Hanlon,
and men such as he, told them so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you mean us to infer from your anecdote
that the client had lost nothing?” asked
Grace with judicial calmness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can I tell? you have the story as I
heard it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because,” proceeded Miss Moffat, “if you
wish to make me believe that the tenants
even in this neighbourhood have no just cause
of complaint—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For pity’s sake,” interrupted Mrs. Perris,
“do not let us open up that question, Grace!
We are none of us landowners. If there
is anything wrong, we are utterly powerless
to put it right. For my own part, I agree
with my husband that nothing could place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the present race of tenants in a better position.
They ought all to be labourers. They
have not money enough to work the land
easily or profitably. If they are miserably
poor it is not because their rent is too high,
but because they have no capital to put into
their farms excepting their own and their
children’s labour.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; and they would shoot anybody with
money, who took a farm and offered to give
them employment, or else burn his house
down about his ears, or set fire to his ricks,”
finished a maiden lady, whose brother, having
tried the experiment of going afield for his
tenants, had been compelled to abandon the
attempt. “Take my word for it, Miss Moffat,
when you become one of the Glendares, you
will see there is another side to the land question
than that espoused by Mr. Hanlon and his
set.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I become one of the Glendares, it
is extremely likely I shall adopt the opinions
of the family on all subjects,” said Grace a
little bitterly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“It is supposed,” remarked the lively
matron who had previously spoken, “that
if Mr. Somerford were in a position to declare
his sentiments, he would side with the
people.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The younger members of great houses are
generally in opposition,” said Colonel Perris’
father, who, by reason of an attack of gout
had been compelled to forego the pleasure of
accompanying Lord Glendare’s remains to the
family vault; “just as men who want to rise
are Radicals, and men who have risen are
Tories. Am I not right, Miss Moffat?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Possibly,” she replied. “Your experience
of life has been much wider and longer than
mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, Miss Grace!” exclaimed the old man,
“how cruel it is of you to remind me how far
behind I have left my youth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not think youth such a particularly
happy season that one ought to regret its
departure,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait till you are old before you decide
that question,” he retorted.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“And others, you would imply,” she added.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And others,” he repeated. “Believe me,
those who think there can be nothing easier
than to put the world right, often find the
operation more difficult in practice than in
theory. Take for instance Mr. Robert Somerford—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps, Mr. Perris, you will defer pointing
a moral by the help of Mr. Somerford
till he is present to hear for himself. I beg
to state I am not the keeper of his conscience.”
And with a heightened colour Miss Moffat
walked to the window, whilst the ladies exchanged
significant looks, and Mr. Perris
chuckled audibly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If they do not come soon, it will be quite
dark before they get to the abbey,” said Mrs.
Mynton, referring to the funeral party, and,
true to her instincts, striving to make matters
comfortable for Grace. “Hush! is not that
the bell?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the bell of St. Martin’s Church tolling
slowly, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They have got to the Black River, then,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>observed Mr. Perris, that being the point
where the parish of Kingslough was supposed
to commence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As they pass through the town the whole
peal is to be clammed—muffled,” said his
daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought it was considered unsafe to ring
all the bells,” remarked Grace, not sorry,
perhaps, to have an opportunity of speaking on
an indifferent subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The risk is to be run to-day, at all events,”
was the reply. “If the tower comes down, and
the ringers are killed, it will be a graceful
opportunity for the new earl to win golden
opinions by rebuilding the first, and providing
for the families of the second.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder if he will remain at Rosemont?”
marvelled Mrs. Mynton.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think he would reside with his
mother,” observed a widow, who had kept
her only son tied to her apron-strings till he
was long past forty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think he would do no such
thing,” said Mrs. Perris decidedly. “He ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>to travel, and get enlarged ideas, and rid
himself of the absurd notion that the earth
was created solely and exclusively for the
benefit of the Glendares.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who is Radical now?” suggested Grace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not,” was the reply; “but I would
have young men be young men, and learn
what is passing in the world, and acquire
fresh ideas. How should any one be benefited
by living with Lady Glendare—a silly,
affected woman?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who must be in grievous trouble,” interposed
Miss Moffat softly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“True, my dear, and I beg her and your
pardon for speaking so ill-naturedly. She
must be in trouble. The earl’s death will
make a great difference to her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She intends to go to her sister, Lady
Martinell, for the present,” Grace explained;
“and Lord Trevor—the new earl—talks of
staying at Rosemont.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At Rosemont! what attraction can he
find there?” exclaimed the company in
chorus.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Mr. Dillwyn thinks it would be advantageous
to the property for him to remain on
the spot for a time at least.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Dillwyn, oh! Mr. Dillwyn, ah!
Mr. Dillwyn has great influence. Mr. Dillwyn
knows all the ins and outs of the Glendare
estates.”</p>

<p class='c010'>These and other expressions like them were
uttered in different tones by the assembled
ladies. In their hearts, perhaps, they had
hoped the death of the earl would prove the
signal for Mr. Dillwyn’s dismissal. Amongst
them there were several who could not have
married the agent themselves, but there were
few who ever intended to forgive his marrying
Mrs. Somerford.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the window stood Grace Moffat, listening
to the storm in a teapot she had brewed so unwittingly.
She was sorry now she had come
into Kingslough. The whole of the talk about
herself and Robert Somerford, the Glendares
and their tenantry, seemed to her ill chosen
on such an occasion.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had longed, with a longing the nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>of which she could not have explained to
herself or any one else, to see the funeral procession—the
hearse, the coaches, the carriages,
the long, long train of mourners. The whole
thing had taken possession of her imagination;
she had brooded over the earl’s death; she
recalled the stories of the Somerfords’ former
greatness; the years when, as legends ran
amongst the poor, their doors stood wide to all
comers; when the gentry feasted in the hall,
and there was plenty and to spare in the
kitchen; when no beggar left the gate unrelieved;
when, let money be spent in England
or abroad, or wherever it might be, with a
careless prodigality, there was no stint at
home; and she contrasted those years with
the later and more evil times upon which the
Glendares had fallen.</p>

<p class='c010'>That was the beginning, this was the end.
From Robert Somerford she had heard histories
of the shifts to which his uncle was compelled
to resort, the anxieties he endured, the small
gratification he was ever able to take out of
his estates, his title, his wife, his children.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>To Grace, who formerly thought the life
of an earl must be one of unqualified happiness,
these revelations proved a disillusion almost
impossible to endure. To be placed so high,
and yet have to stoop so low; to have the
power, apparently, of achieving so much, and
yet to be unable to do anything useful; to hold
the happiness of so many in his hand, and still
to fail in bettering the condition of those most
dependent upon him; to be burdened with
debt, not altogether of his own contracting
but to a great extent, an ever-increasing
legacy handed down from ancestor to ancestor
through generations to him, and yet lacking
moral courage to retrench and live in honour
and comfort, if not luxury,—the whole thing
seemed to her so pitiful, that she could neither
get the life nor the death of the late earl out
of her mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>What would the new earl, invested so young
with such a terrible responsibility, make of
his life? On him devolved the debts, the
duties, the cares, the upholding of an ancient
name. How would he, still almost a boy, support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the burden thrust upon him—the legacy
of debt, the duty of honour, the commission
to put wrong right? How would he act?</p>

<p class='c010'>And if not he, how would Robert Somerford—supposing—only
supposing?</p>

<p class='c010'>She put the idea swiftly aside. Robert was
still only a cadet of a noble house. So far
as she was concerned, she had no desire ever
to see him otherwise, only—</p>

<p class='c010'>Round at that moment went the bells,
taken from the old abbey, open; round
again, muffled; round again open; round
muffled, and still once again, then clammed,
muffled.</p>

<p class='c010'>With tongue silenced, with face a little pale,
each woman hurried to the window; the procession
was at hand—they were about to
see the last in this world of Louis Earl of
Glendare.</p>

<p class='c010'>On came the cavalcade—first the undertaker’s
men, a strange sight in the little town,
then the hearse conveying all that was mortal
of the late earl, then the first coach, containing
the new earl, the Hon. Cecil Somerford, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>late earl’s uncle, a shrivelled, weird old
man, my lady’s brother, and Mr. Robert
Somerford.</p>

<p class='c010'>That vehicle held the probable succession in
this order,—first, the earl, then Mr. Cecil,
then Mr. Robert. It were idle to suppose the
two latter were not calculating chances, even
on the way to the grave.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was quite possible Mr. Cecil might be
a peer before he died. On the other hand,
given some chances in his favour, it was
equally possible Mr. Somerford might step
into the coveted position.</p>

<p class='c010'>How they loved each other, those two
mourners! how they hated each other were
indeed the better phrase; with the low,
vulgar hatred wherewith Mrs. Briggs’ laundress
regards her relation Mrs. Griggs’ nurse
when she imagines Mrs. Wiggs, aunt to both,
has left to the latter a snug sum in the savings’
bank and her personal effects as well.</p>

<p class='c010'>Looking around, and seeing how money
and rank are coveted, which amongst us is
there that should wish to live?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Reverse the notion, and which is there that
should wish to die, and leave such prizes, as
most people regard them, behind?</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly the procession passed along, the sad,
grey waves lapping in upon the shore, wailing
out a requiem for the dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dark and sullen looked the sea under the
leaden sky—like a vast desert the waters
stretched away to the horizon, where clouds
and waves seemed to touch each other.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a sight to make one shiver, that
mournful pageant—that sorrowful sea, and all
the time the bells rang out open, muffled,
clammed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next behind the coach containing the new
earl followed one in which were seated other
relatives of the deceased nobleman, then came
my lady’s brother, then Lord Ardmorne’s
carriage, occupied by himself and two of his sister’s
sons; to that succeeded a long line of carriages
belonging to the gentry for twenty miles
round, then more humble vehicles, covered
and jaunting-cars, phaetons and dog-carts, all
conveying self-constituted mourners to Ballyknock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Abbey, while beside the carriages and
cars rode gentlemen and officers who had
come from far and near to pay the last token
of respect to the late earl.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the procession moved on, the tenants
closed in behind the conveyances.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many of them had walked all the way from
Rosemont; but those selected to keep the
line, so soon as the carriages had passed by,
fell into position as part of the funeral
train.</p>

<p class='c010'>Altogether an impressive pageant, not by
reason of any great pomp or grandeur in the
arrangement, but rather by the mere force and
accumulation of numbers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Along the Parade, past Glendare Terrace,
then making a slight sweep inland, it began
to ascend the steep hill it was needful to climb
before the abbey could be reached.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was late in the afternoon, and the evening
shadows were already to the east darkening
down over the sea, when the hearse
stopped at the rusty gate of the burying-ground,
through which no conveyance could
pass.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>With many pauses, with many relays of
bearers, the heavy coffin was borne into the
abbey, where, in the roofless chancel, with
the heavy branches of the ivy falling across
crumbling walls, the clergyman read the first
part of the funeral service over the remains
of him who had so lately been Earl of Glendare.</p>

<p class='c010'>Borne through the stillness came the cry of
the sea-birds hurrying homeward to their
rocky haunts. The tide, which had turned
some hours previously, was rapidly covering
the shingle, and the waves broke with a monotonous
plash on the beach below Ballyknock
head; whilst seaward, a little between the
town, nestling under its hills, and the extreme
east, over which night seemed to be settling
down, a line of white foam marked the spot
where sunken rocks lay concealed.</p>

<p class='c010'>A dreary landscape to contemplate, a dreary
time and place for such a ceremony.</p>

<p class='c010'>Black yawned the vault where so many
a Glendare slept dreamlessly, and when the
coffin had been lowered and the handful of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>earth was flung upon it, the sound echoed back
upon the ears of the bystanders with a hollow
reverberation which had in it something awful
to the imagination.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was all over, and the multitude dispersed,
tenants, friends, relatives, they had done everything
they could for the dead, and the time
had come to leave him till eternity. Already
the great funeral was a thing of the past, the
late earl a memory. From the east darkness
crept up swiftly, night was coming on apace;
the sheep that, frightened by such a concourse
of people, had stood huddled together
on the hillside, now came timidly back and
made their way over the low broken wall
into the old graveyard; the men whose
business it was to close the vault stood waiting
with their lanterns and tools to begin their
work; but still Mr. Dillwyn could not prevail
on the earl to leave the coffin. Through the
whole of the time occupied in traversing the
long road that stretched between Rosemont
and Ballyknock he never spoke a word, he
never evinced a sign of emotion. During the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>burial service it was noticed by several persons
that he seemed as collected as though the dead
had been neither kith nor kin to him; and the
calmness with which he informed Mr. Dillwyn
that he wished to go down into the vault alone,
for a moment deceived even that astute gentleman
as to his real feelings.</p>

<p class='c010'>Five, ten minutes passed, then Mr. Dillwyn
followed into the charnel-house, where, by the
light of two candles that were flickering in the
draught, he saw the new earl kneeling on the
ground, his arms stretched across the coffin
and his head laid upon them, crying like a
child.</p>

<p class='c010'>He took no notice either of entreaty or
remonstrance. It was all in vain that the
agent tried first to soothe and then to rouse
him. He might have been deaf for any heed
he paid to comfort or expostulation, and when
at length he was almost dragged into the open
air, he continued sobbing as though his heart
were breaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the damp night wind, laden with sea
mist, brought on a violent fit of coughing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>which lasted till they had descended the hill
and entered their carriage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We had better have the windows up,” said
Mr. Dillwyn, the moment they were in
motion, anxiously suiting his actions to his
words.</p>

<p class='c010'>For he saw, and so did Robert Somerford, that
the handkerchief the young man held to his
mouth was stained with blood!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='large'>THE PEOPLE’S FRIEND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Mr. Hanlon casually referred to in the
previous chapter, had been the first to set the
ball of democracy rolling through Kingslough.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not mean that he originated the feeling
of discontent; that he invented a new form of
political religion which he invited the people
to join; or that he introduced strange and
heretical doctrines concerning the rights and
privileges of the powers that then were to the
consideration of those who were many degrees
lower in the social scale. But he gave the
popular sentiment shape; he spoke the ideas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>that had never hitherto found voice; he
turned the dissatisfaction which had long and
silently prevailed, into a wail of complaint,
and then he set his poetry to music; he
wedded the moans of the down-trodden to his
own fervid eloquence, and the men who had
never before got a gentleman to talk their
thoughts for them, hung upon his sentences,
and believed that the good time which each
succeeding generation seeks but never finds—the
good time, so long in coming—was at
hand at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>A gentleman they called him. Well, perhaps
so. And yet, possibly, the hardiest of
his admirers might have hesitated to give him
a niche beside one of the “old stock.” He
dressed better, spoke better, was better educated,
was better looking than any other male
resident in Kingslough; he came of a sufficiently
respectable family, and he was not
destitute of money, nor mean about spending
it. But there was something lacking; something
which, in a different country and a
larger sphere, he might either have lived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>down or corrected, that prevented his making
any mark socially amongst his equals, or
having the right hand of fellowship held out
by his superiors.</p>

<p class='c010'>And under this neglect the man writhed.
The son of an army surgeon who, after seeing
all sorts of places and associating with all
kinds and varieties of men, was well enough
content at last to settle down on his patrimonial
estate of a few hundred acres of bog and call
himself the “squire,” Theophilus Hanlon had,
from the paternal mansion, looked out upon
the world with an ever-increasing conviction
that the world would be exceedingly glad to
welcome his appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was not singular in this idea: other
young men have held the same opinion, and
been disabused of it. The singular thing
about Theophilus Hanlon was that no lapse of
time and no sequence of events seemed able to
teach him the world had not waited—was not
waiting for him with breathless anxiety.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had lived much with women—a bad beginning
for one of his self-conscious, conceited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>temperament. He was clever, and his mother
and sisters and aunt and grandmother lifted up
their hands in astonishment at the extent of
his knowledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>The years spent by Mr. Hanlon, senior, out
of Ireland were not however entirely bare of
fruit. He was wise enough to see that the home
atmosphere did not altogether agree with his
son’s mental health, and that there was not
the slightest chance of Theophilus finding his
level unless he went far afield from Hanlon’s-town
to do it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The result of this was, that although it
sorely crippled his income to educate his son
in England, he sent him to a good school in
one of the midland counties; and when the
lad was considered sufficiently old and well
informed for the purpose, despatched him
to Edinburgh, where, after duly attending
lectures, and going through a very respectable
course of private study, he passed his examination,
and returned to Ireland and his parents
“licensed to kill.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But, as at Hanlon’s-town, it was an utter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>impossibility for him to hope for patients, as
there was nothing in the whole of the neighbourhood
on which to operate, except snipe,
teal, and wild-duck, it became necessary for
the young man to select farther afield the scene
of his future triumphs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wherever he went he had always been a
favourite with women; his curly brown hair,
his hazel eyes, his clear complexion, his upright
figure, his assured walk, his confident
manner, his profound belief in his own abilities,
had won him the admiration of that sex
which is so apt to assume as correct the estimate
men entertain of their own virtues, until
those men chance to become their husbands;
and already Theophilus considered he had
nothing to do except to step across life’s
threshold and walk straight away to success.</p>

<p class='c010'>So far experience had taught him very
little; this Mr. Hanlon, senior, confessed to
himself with a sigh. He might as well have
kept his money as spent it in keeping his boy
at school.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t make out what you want at all,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>said Mrs. Hanlon, to whom he confided his
anxieties. “You might search Ireland
through and not find such another as Phil.
Why he is as upright as a dart, and as handsome
as a picture, and as dutiful as a girl, and
then what is there he can’t do? what is there
he doesn’t know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He doesn’t know anything about himself,”
replied Mr. Hanlon; “and I am not sure that
book learning can quite supply that defect.
However I have done all I could——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And that you have,” finished the warmhearted,
though not overwise matron, “that
you have.” And sold Harkaway, and parted
with your diamond buckles and gold snuff-box,
that the boy might not want a start in life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he won’t forget it to you, he won’t,”
continued Mrs. Hanlon, the tears starting into
eyes bright and hazel like her son’s, and
warming in her Irish idiom as a high-couraged
horse warms to his work; “when he’s driving
through Dublin to the Castle in his carriage
and pair, and another pair to the back of that
in his stables besides, he won’t forget the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>father who gave up hunting for his sake, and
sold the emerald pin out of the breast of his
shirt that his son might want for nothing
among the strangers. It will come home to
you, Larry, your goodness and thought for
that boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I hope so,” said Mr. Hanlon, who
evidently entertained a lower opinion of the
soil in which he had sown for future reaping
than his wife. “Anyhow, I have done all I
could. My judgment may have been at fault,
but according to my light I have done all I
could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Had the opinion of Mr. Theophilus Hanlon
been taken, he would have confirmed the
hopeful augury of his maternal parent.
Judging by results, nothing could be wiser
than the course his father had adopted. Was
not his accent better than English? Had not
one of his lady friends assured him his speech
had all the refinement of the Court of St.
James’s, while retaining the mellow softness of
the seductive Dublin brogue? He had added
another charm, while retaining the old. Was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>not his appearance as attractive as that of
the most fashionably-dressed Sackville Street
lounger? Were not his mental acquirements
far beyond those of most other men? Had he
not learned and remembered, had he not
studied and to good purpose? Were not his
manners fit for a palace? to quote Mrs. Hanlon’s
own words, and to borrow again from
the freely expressed statements of that admiring
parent, “Even to his handwriting,
there was a character and a dash about all he
did.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He could shoot, he could ride, he could
dance; what should stand between him and
wealth, and fame, and happiness?</p>

<p class='c010'>Out in that great world of which Mrs.
Hanlon knew so little, but where she had a
sure faith heiresses were plentiful and confiding,
her boy would, she opined, “Pick up
something worth the lifting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Theophilus had no idea of picking up anything
in a hurry. If he were inclined to
throw himself away, there was a little girl in
Worcestershire he might have for the asking.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>A girl who had made eyes at him when he
was only a schoolboy, and who was mistress of
a very snug fortune. Theophilus knew he
could have her, for she wrote to him frequently
with a certain tenderness of tone, and
on the occasion of his last visit to her uncle’s
house she had gone as close to proposing for
the conceited young Irishman as a girl well
could; but he was still at the entrance of that
wood whence he had liberty to select his
sapling. He would not choose hastily, he
would see what grew to right and left of the
enchanted pathway and cut accordingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Till then behold him a bachelor, careless,
unfettered, free to go wherever chance called
or fate beckoned.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fate beckoned him to Kingslough. The
precise chain of circumstances it would be
tedious to follow; but an old friend of Mr.
Hanlon’s happening to hear he wanted to find
a good opening for his son, a surgeon, wrote
to say Kingslough presented what he sought.</p>

<p class='c010'>Only one medical man in the place, town
improving and extending yearly; becoming a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>fashionable seaside resort; present doctor
breaking up, slightly deaf and sight failing
only necessary to take apartments, and practice
certain to follow. Beautiful scenery;
good society.</p>

<p class='c010'>So averred Mr. Hanlon’s informant, who,
being a man of good connexion, an officer, and
connected with one or two old families in the
north of Ireland, had probably found a visit to
that part of the country very pleasant indeed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Strangers often do find sojourning in a
neighbourhood more delightful than the inhabitants
themselves; perhaps for the same
reason that the good qualities of most people
reveal themselves more fully to acquaintances
than to those of their own household.</p>

<p class='c010'>Englishmen who have visited the Isle of
Saints are always eloquent concerning the
hospitality shown to them. On the same
subject, however, the Irish themselves are
occasionally discreetly silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>After he had been a couple of years in
Kingslough, Mr. Hanlon had many opinions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>to express relative to this matter, none of
them complimentary to the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upon the other hand the inhabitants generally
were not complimentary when they
spoke of Mr. Hanlon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pecuniarily he could not complain of his
success. For a young man and a stranger, he
had a large and not unprofitable practice.
His living cost him little, his habits were not
expensive. He had made friends with the
beggars, he could afford to go his rounds on
horseback, and to wear far finer broadcloth
than Dr. Girvan had ever donned, but the
Kingslough Upper Ten closed their doors upon
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>They would neither let him physick nor
associate with them. To invert the words of a
celebrated wit—they returned his medicine
and dispensed with his visits.</p>

<p class='c010'>Why, who could tell?—they conceived a
prejudice against the man. If he had
crouched to them, perhaps in time he might
have crept his way into their parlours and
drawing-rooms—had he been humble, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>comported himself with commendable bashfulness,
they might possibly have eventually
patted him on the back and bid him take heart
of grace, and not be confounded and overwhelmed
by their condescension.</p>

<p class='c010'>As it was, he held his head too erect, he
spoke with too unabashed a front, he treated
even the highest with too great an assumption
of equality to please people who held their
own heads very high, and when they spoke
expected to be listened to with deference, and
felt themselves to be better than anybody in
the land, unless indeed it might be the Duke
of Leinster and a few others of the same
rank.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a word Kingslough tabooed Mr. Hanlon,
and Mr. Hanlon had his revenge. In our own
times we have seen the effect of a judicious
bone thrown to a very dissatisfied and yelping
leader of discontented masses. In those times
Kingslough felt the effect of not having asked
Mr. Hanlon to dinner. Had they stopped his
mouth with food eaten in good company, the
democrats must have waited a little longer for
the arrival of an exponent of their wrongs.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>As matters stood, since Mr. Hanlon could
not have the gentry, he ranged himself with
the people. Smarting under slights real and
imaginary, he grew rabid against “those
ignorant persons who called themselves the
aristocracy.” “Nature’s gentlemen—those
who delved and dug, those who followed the
plough and worked hardly for that they
earned honestly, were the only form of nobility
he could recognize.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was neither Whig nor Tory; he was
for the people, who were coming to their
rights at last.” “He loved the Irish, but he
could not call mushroom lords or newly
created marquises Irish. By what right did
they hold their lands? Should honest men
be kept serfs and slaves because a couple of
centuries previously a profligate thief had
bestowed stolen land upon one of the members
of his fraternity?” This and much more
said Mr. Hanlon in private and in public.
Whenever in the “wild parts of Ireland,” as
the Kingslough people called the midland and
southern parts of their own country—a compliment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>reciprocated by calling the province
in which Kingslough was situated the “black
North,”—one of those accidents occurred
which are not unusual even now, Mr. Hanlon
pointed the moral and adorned the tale.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not even the “largest circulation in the
world” could have idealized a fact better
than he.</p>

<p class='c010'>Were a landlord shot—and shot plenty of
landlords were—he drew pictures of evicted
tenants, of deserted hearths, of cottages
whence the roof-tree had been ruthlessly torn,
of nursing mothers driven forth to feel their
sucking children dying at the breast; of men
wasted with fever falling by the wayside and
“seeking that justice in heaven they had been
denied on earth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That was Mr. Hanlon’s style of oratory, and
the facts on which he founded it were sometimes
too true; but then he forgot, like all
special pleaders, the other side—the unpaid
rent, the untilled land, the exhausted acres;
the hut it was a disgrace for a man possessed
of his full complement of legs, arms, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>senses to call a house and a home; the half-starved
cow; the greyhound-like pig; the
energetic fowls that laid only because they
sought their food with twenty times the industry
and courage displayed by their owners.
This side of the question of which the “wild
parts of Ireland” presented examples in
plenty, was forgotten by Mr. Hanlon when he
waxed eloquent, and I question much whether
when he so wrought upon the feelings of his
auditors, one amongst them bestowed a second
thought on the man stricken down in his
prime, of the wife left a widow, of the children
orphans.</p>

<p class='c010'>These things which would in England have
driven an orderly population mad, which
would have caused a cry of “blood for blood”
to ring from Berwick to Penzance, failed to
stir the hearts of the northern Irish.</p>

<p class='c010'>They had their ideas about landlords; and
if those ideas failed to find such unmistakable
expression in the North as in other parts of
the island, it was not because their feelings were
less keen or their judgment less critical.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Their passions were not vindictive and
treacherous, like those of the truer, more impulsive,
scarcely civilized Celt, but they were
men more dangerous to arouse, harder to
subdue than any other in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c010'>Where in the annals of that unhappy
country shall we find a parallel to the holding
of Derry, the heroism, the self-denial, the obdurate
determination to win or die?</p>

<p class='c010'>And it was to the descendants of men such
as those who kept the walls of the maiden
city that this man held forth his parable; it
was amongst such enduring fuel that he thrust
his torch, trying to kindle the smouldering
discontent into flame.</p>

<p class='c010'>How he and men like him succeeded there
can be no need to tell. Their success is now
a matter of history. Never perhaps was so
much, for evil as some consider, for good as
others declare, accomplished in a given time
in any country as in Ireland. Fifty years ago,
ay, far less than fifty, the tenant farmers were
of as little account in the estimation of their
landlords as Gurth the Swineherd in the eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>of his master, and now Jack is as good as Sir
Harry in his own eyes, and all the old landmarks
are removed, and a new <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> has
commenced—inevitable perhaps, irrevocable
certainly, but which, nevertheless, no thoughtful
man can contemplate with pleasure, since
progress should be gradual rather than instantaneous,
the growth of years rather than
the result of a political eruption.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thoughtful people in the days of which I
write were much exercised in their judgments
as to what was right and what was wrong.
Thoughtful people have now to accept the
change, be it right or wrong; but in those
days the beginning of the end, was only—and
no one could prognosticate how the event
should prove.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, notwithstanding the fact that women
are fervent politicians, it may very well be
questioned whether they take a new measure
home to nurse, as was the case before they
had learned, or were permitted, to express
their opinions so fluently, as is the case at
present.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Grace Moffat was no politician, though she
belonged to a party, and yet the matters concerning
which Mr. Hanlon discoursed so glibly
were to her subjects of daily and hourly consideration.</p>

<p class='c010'>No one had felt, or could feel more keenly
than she, the rotten state of that fair Denmark
in which her lot was cast; she had lived
too much amongst the people not to have
learned to love and feel for them; but she had
also heard from her father so many remarks
concerning the improvidence and false views
of political economy prevailing in Ireland,
that whilst her sentiments inclined her to
one side, her judgment disposed her to favour
the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus she was in the unenviable position
known as between two stools. When she
listened to the opinions that obtained in Tory
circles, she felt herself a Whig; when she
heard the Radical outpourings, she felt herself
a Tory. Society had never injured her personally,
and therefore she was not disposed
like Mr. Hanlon to sweep away all the distinctions
of society.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>In a word, when the new prophet propounded
one of his favourite theories,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Worth makes the man—</div>
      <div class='line'>The want of it the fellow;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>she felt inclined to disagree with a proposition
which, carried out by Mr. Hanlon, declared
Amos Scott to be a finer gentleman than
Robert Somerford.</p>

<p class='c010'>Theoretically Mr. Hanlon might be right,
practically she resented his doctrines. Taking
a large view of the subject, Mr. Hanlon might
be one of the best and most disinterested
patriots that ever lived; but taking a personal
and private view, Miss Moffat felt she had
rarely met a man who excited in her so sharp
an antipathy. Though not free of the magic
circle in Kingslough, Mr. Hanlon had met
Miss Moffat—of whom in the new form of
language he saw fit to invent for himself when
society refused to recognize his merits, he
spoke as “a good woman,” and Miss Moffat’s
acquaintance with him was more than mere
bowing or a formal How-do-you-do.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>She met him on his rounds when she paid
her visits to the farmers’ wives; he attended
the poor often without asking for fee and
reward, and Miss Moffat had seen that he
did not suffer for his generosity; and thus,
though he had never eaten bread or salt at
Bayview, he was not altogether antagonistic
to Miss Moffat.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the humbling of the aristocrats
took place, he did not desire to see Grace
lick the dust. If he had the management of
public opinion at that juncture, Miss Moffat
should be permitted an independent income,
though, of course, the bulk of her money
must be distributed for the public good.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although she was of age, Grace had not
yet been able to carry out her more juvenile
project of spending her wealth in benefiting
her country. There are practical difficulties
in the way of benefiting a country impossible
to guess, till a person comes face to face with
the problem. One of Miss Moffat’s impediments
was the spirit of the times. She was
not prepared to enrol herself under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>colours of Mr. Hanlon or any one like him.
If ever she married Robert Somerford, she
might then be able to help the people without
compromising herself. Meanwhile she
felt no desire to become a representative
woman. It was enough for her to help the
poor and needy, to comfort the sorrowful, to
provide necessaries for the sick, to soothe the
dying, without entering into the vexed questions
which were disturbing the land.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the depths of her heart she loved the
land and its inhabitants, but she distrusted
those who were about to put all wrongs right
by setting every one by the ears.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the earl’s death matters on the Glendare
estates had not been progressing favourably.
The new earl was abroad, and the state
of his health prevented any satisfactory settlement
of disputed claims.</p>

<p class='c010'>The demagogues had it all their own way.
No one could contradict their statements.
Having always maintained that he personally
knew nothing of any private transactions
which might or might not have taken place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>between the late earl and some of his tenants,
Mr. Dillywn could not now take up arms on
behalf of his late employer, and tell Mr.
Hanlon and the remainder of that clique they
were propagating falsehoods by the score.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the sins, actual and imputed, of the
Glendares since their first advent in Ireland,
were resuscitated for the purpose of rounding
sentences more eloquently, of enabling Mr.
Hanlon and his friends to deliver themselves
of more passionate bursts of oratory.</p>

<p class='c010'>The better classes were becoming anxious.
Let the dead man and his dead ancestors
have been what they would, it was felt that
decency ought to forbid such attacks on those
whose voices were silenced for ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lord Ardmorne had won golden opinions
from gentlemen of all creeds and shades of
politics, by protesting at a public meeting
against the intemperance of Mr. Hanlon’s
observations—the utter irrelevance of his
remarks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No one,” said his lordship, “can accuse
me of being a partisan of that family which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the last speaker misses no opportunity of
vilifying. In theory and practice I have been
opposed to the Earls of Glendare all my life.
Their ways were not my ways; their thoughts,
and ideas, and opinions differed from mine;
but having admitted so much, I go on to
declare that nothing shall induce me to continue
to preside over a meeting where such
licence of language prevails—where the dead
are dragged out of their graves to be gibed at
and reviled—where the sorrow and the
suffering of the living fail to restrain the
buffoonery of a too facile tongue—where
misfortune is spoken of with a taunt, and griefs
are considered fit matters for jest! If such
remarks are persisted in, I shall at once vacate
the chair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After that public rebuke, it might have
been imagined Mr. Hanlon would transfer
his attack from the Glendares to the Marquis.
On the contrary, however, he was wise enough
to swallow the compulsory pill with a good
grace.</p>

<p class='c010'>He apologized in a manner not destitute of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>tact for his indiscretion, and was happy
enough to be able at the same time to wing
a side-shaft at his censor, by saying in a tone
of contrite humility, “He was aware he had
been guilty of bad taste of speaking ill of one
nobleman in the presence of another,”—a
remark which, as it cut two ways, was received
with applause—genuine and derisive.
“If it were a necessity for some to be rolling
in wealth, while others had not a crust to eat,
he could wish all rich men were such as their
noble chairman, or better—supposing that
possible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Altogether Mr. Hanlon held his own whilst
seeming to yield, but he respected Lord
Ardmorne for his straightforwardness and plain
speaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Unlike the Somerfords, who always left
their dirty work to be done by somebody
else,” he said, when subsequently discussing
the scene with one who held opinions similar
to his own; “why, Robert Somerford was
standing by all the time, and never opened
his lips.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Which was indeed quite true, and had
already caused much unfavourable comment,
but then, as Mr. Robert remarked,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have never agreed with the policy of
our family, and much of their practice seems
to me utterly indefensible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still,” urged Grace Moffat, “you surely
might have found some word to speak.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ardmorne said all and more in my opinion
than was necessary,” Mr. Somerford replied.
“Hanlon’s a fool! why should I gratify him
by replying to his folly?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Which was plausible enough and sensible
enough too for that matter, but Grace heard
the sentence with a pain at her heart which
had been coming and going for a long time
past, but which came more frequently and
was less swift about taking its departure as
week followed week, and month succeeded to
month.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was beginning to doubt Mr. Somerford;
to think that, making every allowance for his
uncertain prospects, his dependent position,
his dread of seeming a mere fortune-hunter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>(a character of which he had often expressed
his abhorrence), he had not acted quite fairly
by her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other men gave her at least the chance of
saying no. Not so Mr. Somerford. Her
prejudices against marrying and giving in
marriage might be the same at twenty-four
as at seventeen, but it was absurd to think of
a man honestly playing at the game of fast
and loose for all the years during which he
had been her constant and devoted admirer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Precisely as she had treated John Riley, so
Robert Somerford was treating her, and Grace
was beginning to think very seriously over
his position and hers. She had done so often
since the day of the earl’s funeral. She was
trying to see what she ought to do, how she
ought to act. Instinctively she felt affairs
could not remain as they were.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two lives now only intervened between Mr.
Somerford and the earldom; two lives held
by feeble threads, the strands of which might
any day give way. The fact was well known
in Kingslough; it was discussed over every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>tea-table, and friends with the same frankness
which had distinguished their utterances in
days gone by were now asking Miss Moffat
when she meant to become My Lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>And yet Mr. Somerford had never once
alluded to the possibility either of his attaining
to the peerage or of her assuming a title.
Delicacy might of course have restrained him
in the one case as in the other, but there are
times in life when delicacy may be a little overstrained,
and Grace had arrived at the conclusion
that if Mr. Somerford ever meant to
take her into his confidence, it was high time
he commenced.</p>

<p class='c010'>Would she marry him if he asked her?
Miss Moffat was quite old enough, and quite
sufficient woman of the world to put this
question to herself, and answer it, but, even
mentally, she turned aside from a direct
reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am never likely to be tried,” she said,
fencing with the idea. “Why, in any case,
should I marry? Have the married people
of my acquaintance been so happy that I should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>make haste to run my head into the noose?
And yet if I do not marry, what will my life
prove? I shall be a comfort to my father
for the rest of his days; I can help the poor
a little; I shall either die young, or else
remain till I am old, and be courted and flattered
for my money, and not be able to make
up my mind to whom to leave it. I wish I
could fall in love; I wish I could like some
one, as I think I liked Robert Somerford when
I was a girl. Oh dear, what a beautiful
world this is! Why are we not happier and
more contented in it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>And assuredly it was a lovely scene that
on which Miss Moffat’s eyes rested, as she
paused on her way to the Castle Farm to take
in the beauty of land and sea stretching below
her. Gone were the November mists; the
snows and frosts of winter; past were the
vernal equinoxes; against a clear blue sky
the ruins of the old abbey stood out in sharp
distinctness; with scarce a ripple the sea swept
gently in upon the shore; a burst of April
sunshine illuminated the distant hills; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>fields were dappled with white lambs and
bleating sheep; from the chimneys of whitewashed
cottages, embosomed in trees arrayed
in the tender foliage of the early spring,
wreaths of smoke were ascending almost
straight upwards; by the wayside bubbled
a clear, swift streamlet; the air was filled
with that indescribable scent which departs
ere the hawthorn blossoms open, and is as
surely the smell of quick, healthy vegetable
life, as the decaying leaves of autumn are the
smell of Nature’s death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well might Grace Moffat pause, and look
at the landscape, though she had gazed upon
it hundreds of times previously: for is not a
lovely view like a fair countenance? does not
the beauty grow and grow as each feature
becomes more familiar? did not those who
knew Grace best find some fresh charm each
time they beheld her face?</p>

<p class='c010'>“A delightful morning, and a divine prospect,”
remarked some one close behind her;
and, turning, she saw Mr. Hanlon, who had
come across the fields from Kingslough, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>now, leaping the narrow rivulet, raised his
hat, and then held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you heard the news, Miss Moffat?
No; I see you have not. Lady Jane Somerford
is dead.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Amos Scott’s old lease is out,” added
Grace, uttering the first idea suggested by the
intelligence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Amos Scott’s old lease is out,” he
agreed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What will he do now?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he be well advised, one of three things.
He will rent another farm under Ardmorne as
yearly tenant, and take his chance of being
turned out at the next election unless he
chooses to change his politics; he will sell
every stick he has and go to America, or he
will blow his brains out. As, however, he is
certain not to take advice, no matter how
good, he will probably go to law or try to
defy law and justice so called, in which case
we may predict the final result with tolerable
accuracy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will not Mr. Brady come to terms? I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>would gladly help Scott if any arrangement
could be come to. You are a friend of
Mr. Brady, and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pardon me,” interposed Mr. Hanlon, “I
know the master of Maryville. I attended
his children when they had scarlatina, and
I tried my best to save the little girl who
would die in spite of me; but I cannot claim
the honour of calling myself Mr. Brady’s
friend. Friendship implies some congeniality
of temperament or disposition, and I fear my
nature will never permit of my becoming a
sufficiently finished scoundrel to suit the taste
of Scott’s opponent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then how does it fare with Nettie—with
his wife I mean?” Grace asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You ask me to tell you something, Miss
Moffat, which I do not know myself, which I
do not want to know, of which I should not
speak if I did know. To quote Dr. Girvan,
a medical man should be blind and deaf while
in a patient’s house, and dumb when he comes
out of it. Poor old man! he is fast compassing
the two former states without any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>effort of will; but, indeed, he is right in
principle, more particularly in such a gossiping
little town as Kingslough. This much I
may say, however, without any breach of
confidence; Mrs. Brady is an admirable wife—as
admirable a wife as she is a devoted
mother; and whether she is happy or whether
she is the reverse, no one will ever hear from
her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>For a moment Grace did not reply; her
thoughts were in the far away past, with
Nettie in the days when they two were never
apart, when, if their love was not as pure
and absorbing as that of Hermione and Rosalind,
it seemed to be so. Very grievous had
that severed friendship proved to Grace; and
as she stood silent tears from some hidden fountain
of tenderness welled up and filled her
eyes almost to overflowing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were very fond of Mrs. Brady,” Mr.
Hanlon suggested; he was not possessed of
sufficient sensitiveness, or of that which stands
in as good stead sometimes, sufficient <i><span lang="fr">savoir-faire</span></i>
to appear nonobservant of her emotion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>but Grace Moffat was not one who cared to
wear her heart on her sleeve, and therefore
answered quietly,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am so fond of her still, that the opinion
you express of her husband grieves me more
than I can say. And how will it fare with
Scott?” she went on rapidly. “Surely Mr.
Brady, let him be what he may in other respects,
would not refuse to listen to reason;
but, if paid for it, would be willing to humour
the fancy of a man no longer young, who
hoped to die, as he has lived, on the Castle
Farm. He can have no associations with the
place. It never belonged to him nor to one
of his family. Money, or another farm, would
surely be as valuable in his eyes as our poor
Naboth’s vineyard, and amongst my friends I
am certain—”</p>

<p class='c010'>She paused suddenly. For a moment she
had forgotten herself, forgotten her antagonism
against, her distrust of the man she
was addressing; but the look of undisguised
admiration with which he listened to her
hurried sentences brought her to a stand.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“I must apologize for my vehemence, Mr.
Hanlon,” she resumed, blushing as she felt
with angry consciousness while she spoke.
“Of course you cannot carry my proposal to
Mr. Brady. I will speak to my father. I
will—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think Mr. Somerford would be the
best agent you could employ,” interrupted
Mr. Hanlon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think it most unlikely he would
wish to meddle in the affairs of his most unhappy
family,” she retorted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No one would stand a better chance of
success in persuading Mr. Brady to a distasteful
course than the future Earl of Glendare.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He may never be Earl of Glendare.” She
spoke sharply, almost rudely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is to prevent him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The present Earl may live,—Mr. Somerford
may die.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked at her in amazement. In common
with all Kingslough he had considered
the marriage as settled, the engagement certain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>and yet she spoke coolly of the possibility
of the man dying. Was this feminine finessing,
or an unconscious evidence of indifference?</p>

<p class='c010'>More interesting than the study of man’s
body was the study of man’s mind to this
self-constituted champion of the people’s
rights.</p>

<p class='c010'>He would study Miss Moffat—the greater
included the less; and, although she was but
a woman, still he might learn something
during the course of his investigations that
could be turned to account in his dealings
with men.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were on your way to the Castle Farm,
I conclude, Miss Moffat?” he said. “Will
you allow me to walk there with you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was going to see Mrs. Scott,” said
Grace, “but I will turn back now—I—I
should not like to be present when they hear
the news;” and without any more formal
leave-taking she began to retrace her steps.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a moment Mr. Hanlon stood still, and
watched her retreating figure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is delightful to consider,” he remarked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>to himself, “how in any emergency of this
kind, in a word, when an easy way of backing
out of a difficulty has to be found females at
once take refuge in the delicacy of their sex.
She did not want to walk to the Castle Farm
with me, and so she makes a dislike to the
sight of pain her excuse. She is a good
woman, but the best of Eve’s daughters are
‘kittle cattle’ to have any say to.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='large'>THE MUTTERING OF THE STORM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Meditating that feminine problem which has
puzzled the heads of so many men, wise and
foolish, Mr. Hanlon walked slowly on.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a curious fact that the moment any one
begins to speculate on the motives influencing
the actions of his fellows, he at once flings
aside as untenable the possibility that those
alleged can be true.</p>

<p class='c010'>A good story has been told concerning a
gentleman who offered a friend five guesses
as to how a mutual acquaintance spelt “cat.”
The friend tried every erroneous combination
he could think of, and, each guess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>proving a failure, finally inquired with impatience,
“How the devil does the fellow spell
it, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“C A T,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the same manner people are apt to go far
afield in order to discover causes that really
lie immediately under their noses. Miss
Moffat did not like Mr. Hanlon, it is true,
but no thought of evading his companionship
entered her mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had stated the literal truth when she
said she should not care to be present when
Amos Scott received the tidings of Lady Jane
Somerford’s death; but of course Mr. Hanlon
did not believe this, and so walked slowly on,
full of cynical ideas anent women in general,
and ladies in particular, with a very sufficient
amount of bitterness towards the rich and those
“who called themselves the gentry” added to
the mental draught he was swallowing at the
wish of no one in particular, unless indeed it
might be himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a little time he heard some sound cleaving
the clear, crisp air; and, looking round to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>ascertain whence it proceeded, he saw Miss
Moffat following in his path with rapid steps.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were so lost in thought I could not
make you hear,” she said, looking so honestly
at him with her fine frank eyes, that, remembering
what his thoughts had been, he felt
for the moment almost ashamed of them. “I
called to you a dozen times, at least. It is a
woman’s privilege to change her mind, is it
not, Mr. Hanlon?” she added, “and I have
changed mine. I was a coward for a moment;
but I mean to be brave now, and go to the
Castle Farm with you, if you are not of the
Quaker persuasion, and will allow me to say
yes, after having once said no.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Concerning this speech Mr. Hanlon felt no
inclination to attribute underhand motives;
and yet the fact was that Grace having, after
the manner of her sex, hurried to conclusions
very rapidly, had decided she ought to be
present when the people’s friend bore the news
of his misfortune to Amos Scott.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can do something—some trifle towards
moderating this man’s bitterness and Scott’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>sorrow. Why should I spare myself? Of
what use shall I ever be in the world if I fear
to see grief?” and so she assumed her
pleasantest manner; she talked naturally and
genially, all to try to induce her companion to
“moderate the rancour of his tongue,” and to
bring herself into a frame of mind likely to
influence Mr. Scott and his wife, and to enable
her to advise both of them for their good.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they walked, Mr. Hanlon propounded
the following question to his own soul:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall I make myself agreeable to this
heiress and ask her to marry me? Would not
her money assist the cause I have made my
own? Could not I mould her ideas to mine?
and is there any social position to which, with
her as my wife, I might not aspire?”</p>

<p class='c010'>To a man of his intense self-appreciation the
very idea of such an undertaking was agreeable,
but there were many reasons why he never
carried it out.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the first place, Miss Moffat, with all her
gracious kindness, was not an accessible
person; in the next, he could find no pretext
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>for thrusting his company upon her; further,
he was doubtful as to the reception which his
suit might meet; and fourth and most potent
of all reasons, he felt that the sentiments he
entertained towards the lady were those rather
of awe than affection. She had taken his
measure—unconsciously perhaps, but certainly—and
unconsciously he knew this was so.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upon the whole, Mr. Hanlon decided against
the speculation. It is not always pleasant for
a man to make love to a woman possessed of
sufficient brains to gauge the depth of his
character.</p>

<p class='c010'>There came a day when both fully understood
the other; when she comprehended his
weakness, he her strength. But that day had
not yet dawned when, under the bright spring
sunshine, they walked together to the Castle
Farm.</p>

<p class='c010'>The external aspect of the place was not
much changed since Mr. Moffat had driven up
the divisional road seven years previously, but
time had not dealt leniently with its inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Mrs. Scott, standing in the doorway to give
her visitors “kindly welcome,” looked aged
and haggard; the elder boys and girls had the
appearance of middle-aged men and women
with cares upon their heads, while the
younger children walked about with staid gait
and set faces.</p>

<p class='c010'>There had been something over the place
for years, and that something was now about
to take definite form at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s myself is glad to see you, Miss Grace,”
said Mrs. Scott, “and ye too, doctor,” she
added, turning, with that never-failing courtesy
characteristic of her country, towards Mr.
Hanlon, “this beautiful morning, God bless it!
Sure a day like this puts heart into one. It’s
grand weather for the crops. Amos? he’s out
in the long field, but I will send for him.
Miss Grace, there is a clutch of chickens off to-day,
and one of ducks yesterday. Would you
like to see them? It was only last night I
was saying Miss Grace was fond of the first
brood. But you look white and tired,” she
added suddenly; “Doctor, is not our young
lady well?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“I am well enough in body,” answered
Grace gently, “but sick in mind, sick and sad,
dear Mrs. Scott,” and she put out her hand,
and pressed that of the farmer’s wife as she
spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, Miss Grace?” asked the
woman trembling; “is it the masther? sure
your father was well and hearty yesterday,
and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is your trouble,” Miss Moffat answered;
“and your trouble is mine. Lady Jane is
dead! and I am afraid for Amos—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, God help us! God help us!” cried the
woman, as she threw herself into a chair, and
covered her head with her apron.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will go and meet Amos,” said Miss
Moffat in a low tone to her companion, and,
rising, she left the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well she knew her way to the long field,
not an inch of the Castle Farm but was familiar
to her; it had been almost as much her home
at one period as Bayview, and her heart
sickened as she looked over the familiar landscape,
and thought of those who could soon
look at it no more.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Afar she beheld Amos Scott striding towards
her, a spade over his shoulder, his left hand
swinging free, his gait that of a man whose
mind is in disorder.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he drew nearer she saw his face was
flushed and his eyes bright.</p>

<p class='c010'>The news had already reached him. It was
not left for her to tell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ye’ve heard, Miss Grace, ye’ve heard; and
now they’ll be for trying to turn me out;
that’ll be the next game, won’t it, miss?” he
asked, stopping suddenly, and shooting the
words at her singly, and with a might of suppressed
fear and passion in his tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope not,” she said; “I do hope and
trust, Amos, you will leave this matter to your
friends, and let them settle it for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My friends,” he repeated, “who are they?
Th’ airl, whose father robbed me of my money;
Brady up yonder, who wants to rob me of my
land; Dillwyn, who stands by and says, ‘Hold
hard, Scott: have at him, Brady;’ Mr. Robert,
who puts his hands in his pockets and declares
he has been as badly treated as myself?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“And Grace Moffat, is she not your friend?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“God bless you, Miss Grace; you are the
friend of every man, woman, and child who
needs help, but you cannot help me, I must
help myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was softening—at least she thought so.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amos, I will go to Mr. Brady.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Moffat, I tell you it’s no use; he
has sworn to have this place; but he sha’n’t
have it—no. Not as long as I am aboveboard,
no man, gentle nor simple, shall own the
Castle Farm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you do not own it,” she ventured;
“you only rent it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And where’s the odds, miss? As long as
I paid my rent and my renewals, was it not
mine as much as th’ airl’s? Did not I always
vote for the Glendares’ man, let him be who
he liked? Hadn’t I always my rent ready,
no matter how me and the mistress and the
children fared? Didn’t I do justice by the
land? Look there, miss; would you see
cleaner ground or straighter furrows in the
whole of Ireland? I never grudged the dung,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>even when I had to draw it from Glenwellan.
Though I say it as shouldn’t there is not a bit
of ground better done by in the county. Me
and my sons, haven’t we worked early and
late? and now—but see there, miss, as sure as
I stick that spade in the ground, Brady shall
never have this land. I have took my Bible
oath of that, and I never was one to go back
from my word, let alone my oath.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace shuddered, she could not help doing
so. She knew—none better—what all this
meant, what all this might lead to. She, born
and bred amongst them, understood what a
passion for the possession of land overmasters
the Irish; how it hounds them on to the commission
of deeds at which calmer nations stand
appalled; how, nearer and dearer than wife,
child, honour, life even, an acre of daisy-covered
turf may become.</p>

<p class='c010'>Involuntarily she looked towards the house.
It needed no special gift of prophecy, no extraordinary
amount of imagination, to prefigure
the appearance it would present in days to
come; roofless, doorless, windowless, abandoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>by man and animal, a place near which no
child played by day, a spot no man dare pass
at night—the vision appalled her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come with me, Amos,” she cried; “come
with me to your wife, and let us and the
children talk it over together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They walked side by side in the spring sunshine,
they passed into the house where Mrs.
Scott still sat with her apron thrown over her
head, and Mr. Hanlon, standing with his back
to the great fire, was discoursing to an utterly
inattentive audience concerning abstract principles
of government, and the utterly erroneous
policy—suicidal he called it—pursued by England
to Ireland.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, mother, and so you’ve heard that
the tug of war has come!” began Amos excitedly,
without any formal greeting of his
visitor; “but ye needn’t be feared, ye needn’t
pack up to-day. I’ll have my rights. No
earl, dead or living, shall keep my money and
take my farm—money hard earned, honestly
come by, more nor ever a Glendare could say.
And Brady too—well, he’s not master here
yet, and he never will be.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“It is of no use kicking against the pricks,
Scott, my friend,” said Mr. Hanlon; “the dead
earl and the living rogue will be too many for
you in the long-run. You’d best take another
farm, or, better still, sell your goods, while you
have any to sell, and go away to a free country,
where you and your children can have liberty
to work for yourselves instead of for a landlord;
where you can live like men instead of
worse than dogs; where you will be able to
call your souls your own, and be rid of the
yoke under which the toilers in this wretched
country groan from the cradle to the grave.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thank you for yer advice, Doctor; I’m
sure it’s well meant and kindly given: but I
am not going to America, and I have no intention
of leaving the Castle Farm—till I am
carried out of it feet foremost,” said Scott, not
without a certain dignity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But supposing no arrangement can be
made with Mr. Brady, Amos?” Grace began.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No arrangement can be made, Miss Moffat,”
interrupted Mr. Hanlon. “He is a very Shylock,
he will have his pound of flesh though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the fairest Portia in Ireland seek to prevent
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know rightly what you are talking
about,” said the poor dazed farmer; “but if it
means that Brady’s going to take my home
from me—that when it comes to the bit, Mr.
Dillwyn and the young airl will stand by and
see me and mine driven out to die by the
roadside—just let him and them try it, that’s
all. I’m a man of few words, but you can all
of you remember what I say, let them try it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, Amos,” pleaded Grace, “is not one
farm as good as another?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Grace, I wonder to hear you!” he
answered reproachfully. “Would another
wife be as good to me as her yonder? would
other children be as good to me as those I have
dandled on my knee, and sat up with when
they were sick, and ‘threatened’ when they
were impudent to me and the mother, and
given the ‘tawse’ to when they wouldn’t do
what they were bid? Oh! ye don’t know—Lord
forbid ye ever should—what a home
means to a man of my years, that the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of the land are conspiring to leave homeless.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poor Amos!” murmured Grace, with a
pity too deep for words welling up in her tone.
“I think—I hope I do understand what you
feel; still place ought not to be so dear as
people. If I had to leave Bayview to-morrow,
I believe—I feel certain I could in time learn
to love another place almost as much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ay, but then you are a woman, and that
makes all the differ,” commented Mr. Scott,
with that sublime contempt for the sex which,
spite of their gallantry, is a fundamental characteristic
of his class in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is quite true,” she answered, with a
faint smile. “I am only a woman; if I were
a man, I would try to do more to help you.
As it is, I do not want to see you break your
own and your wife’s heart for no good purpose.
Come, Amos, be persuaded; let me look you
out a farm. It shall not cost you a penny to
go from the one place to the other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And let the young airl keep the money his
father robbed me of; and let Brady laugh and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>say, ‘I got the best of him, as I have of everybody
else’? No, faith, if he laughs when he
has done with me, it’ll be on the wrong side
of his mouth I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not go away, then, where it cannot
matter whether he laughs or cries? Land is
cheap enough in America; and you may be
your own tenant, and landlord too for that
matter. You might found a family there, and
be a great proprietor before you die.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean well, Miss Grace, and I am
beholden to you; but you don’t understand.
I’d rather have my own bit of ground here,
that I know every rood of, than own the whole
of Canada. What would I do among strangers
and foreigners? It is not much I want—only
my rights, and I’ll have them,” he went on,
lashing himself up into sudden fury. “Come,
mistress, what are ye sitting for there, and the
work all standing? and what am I doing here,
talking foolishness, while the men and the
horses are idle in the field? Good morning,
Miss Grace, and thank you kindly, and you too,
Doctor, and if ye see Brady, and me and my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>farm come up, ye can tell him Amos Scott is
not going to be put upon or turned out of the
land he paid his golden guineas for to him
that’s dead and gone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Having delivered his mind of which speech,
the farmer hurried out of the house, followed
by some of the younger children.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he was gone, Mrs. Scott put down
her apron, and drew her hand wearily over her
eyes, that ached because no tears would come.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ye’ll excuse him,” she said, speaking to
both her visitors, but addressing her remarks
more especially to Grace; “he is not himself.
He is just out of his mind with trouble. He
has been a changed man since th’ airl died,
and the young lord went away without putting
the wrong right. Everything is going to the
bad with us. What the end of it will be, I
don’t know, I’m sure I don’t!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish Amos would listen to reason,” said
Grace, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the use of his fighting when he
has got money, and rank, and law, and power
all against him?” observed Mr. Hanlon.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“Ah! Miss, as he says, you don’t understand;
what seems reason to you, sounds like
folly to him; and as for every body and thing
being against him, Doctor, each word you say
concerning that makes him madder. A lion in
a cage could not be worse nor him when anybody
speaks to him about having to leave the
old place and see Brady get it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it is not the first time by many the
same thing has been done,” urged Mr. Hanlon.
“Renewal fees have been taken time after
time on this estate, and the people who paid
fought the matter out, and ruined themselves
just as Scott will do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Somebody must win, Sir,” she answered, in
unconscious vindication of her husband’s tactics.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I had better go now,” suggested
Miss Moffat. “It seems to me we are working
more harm than good. After a few days,
perhaps, Amos will come to Bayview, and let
me know what he intends doing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have to call at Maryville,” said Mr.
Hanlon, looking at Grace as though he imagined
she might regret his inability to accompany
her home.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“Any one ill there?” inquired Miss
Moffat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The youngest boy is ailing a little.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What terrible bad health Mrs. Brady’s
children have, to be sure!” exclaimed Mrs.
Scott.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered Mr. Hanlon with a laugh:
“Doctor Girvan says the young ones about
Kingslough were strong enough when he had
more to do with them. Inference obvious.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Maryville a healthy place?” asked
Miss Moffat, looking straight into Mr. Hanlon’s
face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pretty well for some people, not for
women and children, I should say.”</p>

<p class='c010'><em>His</em> meaning was obvious, at least so Grace
decided; “I must know something about
Nettie,” she thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will tell Mrs. Brady I have had the
pleasure of meeting you,” said Mr. Hanlon,
as if guessing what was passing through her
mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, please do,” cried Grace eagerly;
“and tell her how sorry I am to hear of her
little boy’s illness.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>When next Miss Moffat met Mr. Hanlon,
she asked,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you give my message to Mrs.
Brady?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did,” he answered, with a curious smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what did she say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing,” he replied, adding, as Miss
Moffat turned red and tried to help looking
annoyed, “that is about the extent of Mrs.
Brady’s conversation with any one. She listens
when she is obliged to listen, and answers
when she cannot well avoid doing so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poor Nettie!” said Grace involuntarily,
and she fancied she heard her companion
mutter,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poor indeed!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Before Miss Moffat reached the end of the
divisional road on her way homeward from
Amos Scott’s, she heard hasty footsteps following,
and, looking back, saw the farmer’s eldest
son striding after her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Could I speak a word to you, Miss Grace?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As many as you like,” she answered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>and at once took her seat on a large stone
lying close at hand, to show him she was in
no haste, but could listen to all he had to
say.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the interview at his own home the
young man had sat on a settle near the fire,
his body bent forward, his head drooping, his
hands clasped. He never opened his lips, he
never lifted his eyes save once, and that was
to look at Mr. Hanlon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, however, the spell seemed broken,
and he began eagerly,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Grace, will you help me to go to
America?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You, David—without your father?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Miss, he’ll never go—leastways, I
don’t believe he will; and my heart is just
broke, to see things going on as they are at
home. What for should I not go? If I stay
here, I’ll have to hire myself as a labourer—maybe
to Brady. Father ’ll fight him till we
haven’t a bed left to lie on. Since the earl
died he has been like a man possessed. He
carries on about the Glendares and Brady till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>I’m fairly sick and tired of hearing their
names. I don’t say but he has been badly
treated. It was a stocking full of money he
gave the earl; but, as Mr. Dillwyn says, if he
was so foolish as to let his hard earnings slip
through his fingers on the strength of a bit of
a promise, he must take the consequences.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must not speak so disrespectfully of
your father,” said Grace severely; “it is not
right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not intend any disrespect, Miss,” he
answered. “I’d do as much—I have worked
as hard for him as a son could; but I’m not a
child, and I can’t shut my eyes to what must
come of all this. He won’t leave, and Brady
will take the law of him, and we’ll all be
brought to beggary. He was headstrong
enough before Mr. Hanlon came to Kingslough—bad
luck to the day he left his own part of
the country—but to hear him discoursing now,
anybody might think he was distraught.
What is the use of talking about wrongs unless
they can be put right? Maybe, Miss,
you consider I am speaking wild-like, but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>sometimes feel as if I was going crazy myself.
Once we could eat our stir-about<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and potatoes
in peace, but now I often have to leave my
breakfast and dinner for fear I should be
tempted to say something that might put a
division between us.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Oatmeal porridge.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, David,” she cried, “do stop, please,
you hurt me! When I think—when I think
of the happiness and contentment I have seen
in your home, I feel as if I could not realize
the present misery—as if I would do anything,
give anything to put matters straight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And when I think, Miss,” he rejoined, “I
feel as if I could go up to Maryville, and shoot
Brady on his own door-step,—and I would too
if it could do us any good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not talk in that wicked, reckless way,”
said Grace; “it was not Mr. Brady’s fault that
the late earl took your father’s money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was his fault, taking the land at any
rate,” returned the young man doggedly.
“What did he want with it? Wasn’t there
farms to be had in plenty without ours? Was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>it fair dealing to make a bid for it over my
father’s head, turning an honest family out of
house and home? I never hear our minister
read that chapter about the man who had a
vineyard he wouldn’t sell, or about that other
who had only one yow<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>-lamb, but it puts me
in mind of our farm and Brady. We had but
one vineyard, and I misdoubt me much if it
doesn’t cost my father his life. We had only
one yow-lamb, and he wants that from us.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Ewe.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>His voice quivered as he spoke; the passion
and pathos of his country lent eloquence to his
words, homely though they were; and tears,
which she could not restrain, coursed slowly
down Miss Moffat’s cheeks at the picture of a
shattered home presented to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amos could never make another; she clearly
understood that if by no effort the Castle Farm
could be preserved, his future presented no
prospect but that of utter shipwreck. She
could see the misery, the poverty, the certain
ruin, the possible crime, but she could perceive
no way of averting the calamity.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Her will, her money, her influence, were
powerless here. A wrong had been committed
which only one man living could put right, a
wrong which, simple as it seemed, made her
for the moment marvel how the earl could rest
in his grave, considering the wretchedness his
act had wrought. Never before had she
touched that hard spot in the Irish nature
which has puzzled the most thoughtful of
psychologists, and baffles the wisdom of
the wisest statesmen, which not time, or
experience, or kindness, or remonstrance
can soften, and which seems as indifferent
to severe treatment as it is insensible to
gentle handling.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had any one told her a year previously that
Amos Scott would turn a deaf ear to her
entreaties, her advice, her offers of assistance,
she must have laughed outright; and yet,
behold, it was not more than an hour since she
walked up to the farm with Mr. Hanlon, and
already she felt herself beaten.</p>

<p class='c010'>As she could not help Amos to what he
wanted, he would not have her help at all.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>She was powerless to give him the Castle
Farm, and consequently he turned his back
both on her assistance and her advice.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had thought, in her ignorance, money
and the will to give it could effect almost anything;
and yet here was a case where it could
effect nothing, literally nothing, unless Mr.
Brady could be bought off.</p>

<p class='c010'>She would try if that were possible. It was
a forlorn hope, but it was a hope nevertheless.
She would see Mr. Dillwyn and Mr. Somerford,
and, if need be, Mr. Brady himself; and she
was planning the form of words she should
use, when her short reverie was broken by
David,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“So, Miss, when I heard you speaking so
kind and sensible, I made up my mind I would
ask you to lend me enough to go away. I can
be of no sort of use here. If I stay, I may do
an injury to myself or somebody else. I have
long had it in my mind—months,—ever since
the earl lay a-dying.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I thought you were going to be
married?” suggested Miss Moffat.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“I am ‘speaking’ to Maggie Lennen; but
I’ll never marry her, Miss, if I can’t better
myself. She’ll wait for me, and when I am
able to send for her, she’ll come out; and
then, if things go as I am feared they will, I
can spare a pound now and then to my
mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you would leave her to bear all this
trouble alone?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She won’t be alone; she has the rest of
them. I wish we were every one of us
sailing to-morrow; but as that can’t be,
I’ll go. I have made up my mind, Miss
Grace, whether you lend me the money or
not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will not say ‘yes,’ neither will I say
‘no’ to-day. I will think over what you have
told me, and see whether nothing can be done
for your father. I am more grieved for his
trouble than words can tell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! Miss Grace; its yourself had always
a kind heart. If the old man didn’t seem to
set a right value on your goodness to-day, it
was only because he is not just himself. He’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>that throng<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> with sorrow, he can’t fairly understand;
but the time will come when he’ll mind
it all. I don’t say much, and mother she says
nothing; but we feel. If our heart’s blood
could serve you, there is not one of us but
would give it. There is nothing father would
not do for you, letting alone leaving the
farm.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Busy.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“I think that is always the way, David,”
she said, with a mournful smile. “The
‘except’ is generally the one request we make.
Suppose, now, I were to ask you, as a personal
favour to myself, to remain with your parents;
you would say, ‘I will do anything for you,
Miss Grace, but that.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would not,” he answered vehemently.
“If you bid me stay, I’ll stay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will neither bid you stay nor go,” she
replied, “till I have talked the matter over
with people older and wiser than I am.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And so saying, she rose and wended her
steps slowly homewards.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“You may find people older, and maybe
wiser than yourself, Miss Grace,” soliloquized
the young man, as he watched her retreating
figure, “but ye’ll never find anybody better,
search the wide world through.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not the fashion generally to admit the
fact, and yet a great deal of disappointment
might be spared the rising generation were
parents, guardians, and others to assure them
no money yields such poor interest as that invested
in philanthropic pursuits.</p>

<p class='c010'>There may be many reasons for this besides
the innate wickedness of mankind, but one
seems sufficient for the present purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>Taking philanthropy as a rule, we find it
desires not merely to help its fellow, but to
help him in its own way; and as there is probably
nothing more difficult to do than this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>when the good intended and the good effected—when
the gratitude due and the gratitude
received come to be balanced—the well-meaning
benefactor generally finds himself considerably
poorer, and no one else very much the better
than if he had been content to leave well
alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Truth is, kindly disposed persons are apt to
imagine that money has the power of conferring
upon them the position of a sort of minor Providence;
and then, when the events they have
influenced, and the changes they have wrought,
turn out to have worked together for anything
rather than good, they are inclined to become
misanthropical.</p>

<p class='c010'>Few men who benefit their fellows have the
slightest idea of leaving them free-will; and
when free-will rises and asserts itself, philanthropy
is very naturally disgusted at such a
display of ingratitude.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps when those who give and those who
help, give and help merely because it is right
to do both, and not because they expect thanks
or return, doing good may prove a more useful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>and pleasant pursuit than is generally the case
at present.</p>

<p class='c010'>No idea of exorbitant interest in the shape
of either thanks or gratitude had influenced
Grace Moffat in any of the efforts she made to
ameliorate the condition of the men and women
by whom she was surrounded; nevertheless, it
was scarcely in human nature to avoid feeling
a sort of sick disappointment when she came
calmly to review the incidents of her visit to
the Castle Farm.</p>

<p class='c010'>With all her heart she desired to set matters
straight for Amos Scott; but the longer she
thought, the more difficult the task appeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had little hope that Mr. Brady would
relinquish his claim. She could not see in
what way either Mr. Dillwyn or Mr. Somerford
might help her in the affair. In any event
she was not sufficiently strong-minded to apply
to one of the three, without first taking some
friend into her confidence, and friends likely
to take the slightest interest in the farmer’s
concerns had passed beyond Grace’s reach.
She had her father, however, and although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>his views on all such subjects were well known
to her, she determined to consult him.</p>

<p class='c010'>For love of any abstract principle of right,
or any general affection for his fellow-creatures,
she was perfectly aware he would not lift a
finger; for love of her, however, he might be
moved to exertion; at any rate, she would
try.</p>

<p class='c010'>She chose the best hour in the day for her
attack—that when the cloth was removed, and
the dessert reflected itself from the face of a
shining mahogany table—when the door was
closed, and the servant gone, and the wine
placed near the elbow of Mr. Moffat’s chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>A bright fire blazed on the hearth; no sound
broke the stillness, save an occasional gust of
wind blowing amongst the trees. Mr. Moffat
liked the fire, and the perfect sense of solitude.
He sat looking into the blaze for a few
minutes, and then, turning to his daughter,
remarked,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very quiet this evening, Grace;
are you not well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” she replied, “but I am troubled and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>vexed and perplexed. I want to consult you,
papa; may I?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly, my dear, having already, no
doubt, made up your mind whether you mean to
say yes or no.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She smiled and coloured. “I think I have
come to an end of my suitors,” she answered.
“It is quite six months since any one made
love to my fortune. I am not in a perplexity
of that kind, but I am greatly troubled about
poor Amos Scott.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is wrong with him now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lady Jane Somerford is dead, and the land
consequently belongs to Mr. Brady.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?” Mr. Moffat’s tone was not
encouraging. Truth is, feeling a certain
amount of self-reproach at not having
interested himself in the smallest degree
about Mr. Scott’s affairs when that interest
might have proved beneficial, he would now
have preferred ignoring the subject altogether.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless, when Grace remained silent,
he repeated his inquiring “Well?” with a
slight access of irritability.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Dear papa,” she said gravely, “if it vexes
you to hear me talk of these things, say so,
and I will be silent, only—only—if I may not
come to you for advice in my trouble and perplexity,
where can I go?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He stretched out his hand, and drew her towards
him. “Gracie darling, talk away, and
I will help and advise you if I can; but I am
old, and you are young; and young people
think it an easy matter to put the world right,
and we old people know it cannot be done.
That is all. If you will make allowance for
me, I will for you. Now say on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amos does not want to leave his farm,”
she began, after kissing him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Naturally—no Irishman ever did,” was
Mr. Moffat’s comment on this announcement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think there is any chance of his
being able to remain?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not the slightest; Brady has law on
his side, and he is not the man to forego his
rights—at least, so I am assured. Of the man
I myself know nothing, and want to know
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“But do you not think, if it was made worth
his while to forego them, he might do so?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Meaning, I suppose—do I not think, if
soft-hearted Grace Moffat liked to make herself
by some hundreds of pounds a poorer woman
than she is to-night, would Mr. Brady give up
the Castle Farm? No, my dear, I do not;
Mr. Brady has, as I understand, many undesirable
qualities. Amongst others he is
intensely Irish—using that expression in its
most disparaging sense. I do not mean that
he is Irish in impulsiveness, recklessness,
generosity or folly; but he is Irish in cunning,
in hatred, in revenge, in acquisitiveness, in
every undesirable quality the worst classes in
Ireland hold in common. He has been waiting
for this land for years; grudging Scott his
possession, and yet gloating over every stone
the poor wretch laid, one on the top of another,
for his (Brady’s) benefit. You may give up
the notion, Grace; money will not give Scott
back the Castle Farm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you not think the Glendares might?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“You can try, Gracie.” Mr. Moffat said
this very drily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean do you not think Mr. Brady might
be susceptible to the influence of rank?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not exactly see how rank is to use its
influence,” was the reply; “and, if I did, I
believe Mr. Brady would talk rank over.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have not much opinion of the Glendare
strength of character,” she said, as though in
jest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps I have not much opinion of any
part of the Glendare character,” he answered
bitterly. “However, that is a question we
need not discuss to-night. If I understand
you rightly, you thought, perhaps, some member
of that family might exert his or her influence
over Mr. Brady. Suppose the experiment
worth trying—who is to try it? Not
the young earl, who is dying, no doubt, with
a rapidity commendable in the eyes of the next
heir, who, in his old age, it is said is seriously
considering matrimony; not that next heir,
who, whether earl or not, will never consider any
human being except himself; not Lady Glendare,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>whose star has waned; not Mr. Robert
Somerford—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?” Grace inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I am sure I can scarcely say why,”
returned her father. “Try him, my dear;
ask him to use his influence; perhaps he
might, if he has any. Perhaps Mr. Brady
might be influenced by him. Mr. Somerford
has received a certain amount of kindness from
us during the last seven years; perhaps he
would not object to do us a trifling kindness
in return. It is all problematical, Grace. I
have not much faith in its satisfactory solution,
but you can try.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a pause, during which Grace sat
with her cheek resting on her hand, her
thoughts straying over many subjects, and not
one pleasant subject amongst the number.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is there not such a thing as equity?” she
inquired at length.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you mean in law or in public opinion?”
asked her father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In law.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is a thing called equity.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“Would it not help Amos?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Most decidedly not. Nothing can help
him. No person can help him unless he like
to help himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can he do that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He made a mistake once by acting on his
impulses; he had better not make a second by
following his impulses again. He has had a
long, long term of his farm, but now he will
have to leave it, and he ought to leave it
peaceably. He cannot fight with the least
chance of winning. If the dead earl came
back to life, he could not remedy the wrong
wrought by his carelessness. Scott might
establish a claim against him, if the fact of
ever having received money could be recalled
to the memory of a Glendare; but money is
not what Scott wants; he wants his farm, and
all the king’s horses and all the king’s men
could not give it to him. Brady is the only
man who could, and he won’t; and the sooner
Scott realizes that fact, the better for him and
all belonging to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You think his case hopeless, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“Utterly—so far as his present holding is
concerned. There are other farms—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” she said, “but the Castle Farm is
to him just what I am to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>For a minute after neither spoke. Involuntarily
Mr. Moffat’s thoughts sped back to that
bright summer’s day when first he heard of the
Earl’s Promise, and never thought of asking a
question concerning it.</p>

<p class='c010'>If he had known then, by one sentence he
might have averted the misery now close at
hand. He might have asked, “What have
you got to show for this? where is the earl’s
receipt? where his promise in any shape that
shall avail you hereafter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He might, with his knowledge of the world
and its weary, wicked ways, have stood between
this poor, hard-working, trusting son of the
soil, and ruin. It all came back to him, as
past sorrows sometimes do, in a bad dream,
with their anguish fresh as at the original
moment. It all came back: what he might
have done—what he had left undone. The
years returned, each one laying a reproach at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>his feet ere gliding away to give place to its
successor.</p>

<p class='c010'>He saw his motherless child returning bright
and happy from her visits to the Castle Farm;
he beheld the honest faces of those from whom
she had never learnt harm—nothing but good;
he could recall the words in which she recounted
the day’s doings, when she went to visit the
Scotts, clearly as if it had all happened yesterday;
he could see her bringing back treasures
for him to inspect, turning out her little pocket
that he might look at all she had got.</p>

<p class='c010'>And when she was ill of some childish disorder,
had not Mrs. Scott left her own home to
come and help nurse her? Through all the
years, had the love and respect and admiration
they felt for his darling ever abated?</p>

<p class='c010'>Ah! well-a-day! Oh! tiring, harassing
memory!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Grace—” he began.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, papa!” she said, waking from her
reverie with a start.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not a demonstrative man; I do not
talk in a general way about what I feel; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>if money could enable Scott to stay where he
is, money should not be wanting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The truth of this statement was not likely to
be put to the test, but Grace knew he meant
what he said—every word.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If anything could make me happy to-night,”
she murmured, “that assurance would;
but, oh, papa, it is dreadful to think what may
come of all this, and we powerless to avert the
evil!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ay, Gracie, it is,” he answered. “By
the time you are my age you will know there
are many evils we are powerless to avert.
But now listen to me, child: speak to Robert
Somerford, and see what he will do in the
matter. If that fail, I will see what I can do
myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not reply to him verbally; she only
took his hand, and stroked and kissed it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Remember,” he went on, with a sudden
change of tone, “I am now acting in entire
opposition to my own principles. I have
always believed in letting other people manage
their own affairs, in allowing them to get into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>difficulties if they please, and getting out of
them as they can. My opinion about Ireland
has always been that her misfortunes arise as
much from the laxity as the severity of her
landlords. I consider the whole system of
tenant-right a mistake. I have been, and am,
utterly at a loss to conceive why the fact of a
man having rented a farm for a certain number
of years, during which he has probably exhausted
the land, and allowed the house and
outbuildings to fall into decay, should entitle
him, and his children after him, to a renewal
of the lease. I do not see, if I were a landlord—which
happily I am not—why, supposing I
prefer one tenant who applies for a farm rather
than another, the one I prefer should have his
ricks burned down or find his best mare hamstrung.
I do not see the beauty of charity;
in my opinion it benefits neither him who gives
nor him who receives—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh fie, papa!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear, I only speak the truth. What
good to themselves or any one else are those
sturdy and picturesque beggars who come to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>you as regularly for their Saturday’s dole as if
they were annuitants, or had worked for a
week’s wages?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would rather give them wages,” she said;
“but what am I to do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not interfere with your almsgiving,
Grace; nevertheless it seems to me that whilst
you are relieving distress, you are perpetuating
an evil.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you really believe,” she asked, “that
the little I give away does me no good?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope it does you no harm—that is the
utmost I can say. I do not think it a wise
thing to assist in pauperizing a nation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we are expressly told that the poor
shall be with us always.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Granted; but you do not mean, I suppose,
to interpret the poor into professional beggars?
I am not much interested in Ireland or the
Irish; most persons would call me, and call
me truly, an unobservant man; yet there are
things passing every day before me to which I
cannot shut my eyes; which you, Grace, would
see as plainly as I if you did not wilfully shut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>your eyes. First of all, I behold a number of
landlords who reside principally out of Ireland,
for the very good reason that they prefer living
in London, or Paris, or Florence, or Vienna,
wherein they show their discrimination. Immediately
there is a cry about the evils of
absenteeism, the popular idea being that if a
man resides in Ireland he must of necessity
spend his income in Ireland likewise, just as
though any English duke, or earl, or baronet
spent the whole of his income at his country-seat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you think there is a little difference
between the two cases?” said Grace.
“If the Irish landlords resided in Dublin, for
instance—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear girl, do you suppose that would
satisfy tenantry residing in the north? What
the malcontents really want is to have the
‘good old times’ back again; when there was
open house and a ‘bite and sup’ for everybody,
broken victuals for the beggars, and a ‘drain
of whiskey and a cut of mate’ for persons
supposed to be ‘earning their bread,’ whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>chance, design, or necessity led into kitchens,
the doors of which always stood wide. To
put it in a sentence, people are now living
almost at the end of a system, and they want
to go back to the beginning of it, to the time
when there was plenty of money instead of
beggary; to the commencement of borrowing,
and mortgaging, and taking credit, instead of
paying back, and bankruptcy, and no money,
no goods; to the wild, reckless youth of families
which are now expiating in unhonoured
old age the sins and the follies of that faraway
time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was truth in the picture he drew, and
his daughter felt it; but the truth was bitter,
the picture too faithful in detail to be perfectly
life-like in fact.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But surely people are not to be blamed
because they look back to the good old times
with regret, and wish they could all come
over again?” said Grace, whose imagination
had often held high revel amongst those past
days and doings of which her father spoke so
contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“Were they good old times?” he asked,
with unwonted animation. “By the grain
men reap, by the fruit they gather, we can
tell the sort of seed, the manner of tree which
was sowed and planted by those who went
before. There was wild sowing, there has
been bitter reaping, and there will be reaping
still more bitter before Ireland becomes the
paradise patriots (so called) conjure up before
the imagination of an excitable, passionate,
dissatisfied people.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What would benefit Ireland, papa?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can I tell, child? Can the work
of centuries be undone in a day? can the education
of generations be unlearned at the word
of command? If the country and the people
be let alone, perhaps they may do something
for themselves, but I am extremely doubtful
about the matter; it very rarely happens that
those who have been for eleven hours praying,
entreating, cursing, threatening in order to
obtain help, turn round at the twelfth and
help themselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How prejudiced you are!” she said, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>sorrowfully holding his hand the while; “you
only look at the faults, you never think of the
virtues and the wrongs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear Grace, if there be one thing I
dislike more than another, it is the use of cant
expressions. That is probably the reason why
I have always eschewed mixing myself up in
political matters. There is something particularly
offensive to me in the war-cries of
party; and, speaking confidentially, I object
quite as much to the music of ‘Vinegar Hill’
as of ‘Protestant Boys.’ You have managed
to adopt some cant phrases, as for instance,
that you used just now. Tell me, if you can,
what are Ireland’s wrongs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The poverty, the distress, the misery.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything else?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The way in which the Irish are looked down
upon by English people, the laws that press so
heavily on the Roman Catholics.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything else?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The money earned in a country being
spent out of a country, the men who earn that
money living so hardly; Ireland being taxed
for the benefit of England.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Anything else?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! yes; there are hundreds of other
things, but I have mentioned sufficient.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you must have been sitting at the
feet of Mr. Hanlon, Grace,” answered her father.
“If either you or he can prove to me that
Ireland is taxed for the benefit of England, I
shall be surprised. On the contrary, Ireland
is exempt from many most irritating taxes
which clever chancellors of the exchequer have
devised for the express purpose of reducing
that plethora of riches from which Englishmen
are supposed to suffer. The amiability of Britannia
has even exempted Ireland from the
soap-tax; another instance, I conclude, of that
brutal ignorance of Irish wants concerning
which Mr. Hanlon speaks so freely. To a
nation that thinks the use of water unnecessary,
it seems nothing less than an insult
to give soap free. As to your next point,
making my way backwards, men who earn
money live hardly everywhere. It is in the
nature of things; from the London merchant,
toiling to leave a fortune or found a family, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Amos Scott, labouring to meet the next ‘gale
day,’ the worker must live hard. Then you say
it is wrong that money earned in a country
should be spent out of it. Perhaps so, but I
fail to see how you would propose to remedy
the evil.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would make all the people who derive
their income from Ireland live in Ireland,”
said Grace energetically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me you would be guilty of a
great injustice, then,” he replied; “but, however,
we will suppose, for the sake of argument,
that the plan you suggest is fair and
practicable. Suppose, in a word, you have
the landlords here, how is the money to be
kept in Ireland? Are the nobility to have
their portraits painted by local artists? are
they to buy the pictures on their walls from
some vague Milesian genius, and their statuettes
from a Celtic stone-mason? Are their
wives and daughters to play music composed
by the parish organist, on pianos made by an
enterprising country carpenter? I suppose
you would have the gentlemen wear frieze and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>carry bog-oak sticks, and the ladies array
themselves in poplin and Limerick lace. You
would have the houses furnished with chairs
and tables made from arbutus wood, and the
cabinets filled with ‘speciments’ from the
Giant’s Causeway and tokens from Killarney.
Turf should be burnt universally, instead of
English or Scotch coal. That is the only way
to keep money in a country, Grace. Does the
programme please you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are jesting with me,” she said, “and
yet you would not, if you knew how near it
all lies to my heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What lies near your heart, Gracie? which
of the grievances? I am running through
them as fast as I am able. Which was the
next sorrow? Oh! I remember, the Roman
Catholics. Well, they certainly had a considerable
number of grievances at one time, but that
time is past and gone. The Protestants, at
one period of England’s history, did not sleep
exactly on roses, so that perhaps there might
be some excuse to urge even in this matter.
I do not want to excuse, however. It is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>pity, to borrow one of Mr. Hanlon’s figures of
speech, that the Roman Catholics ‘ever were
trampled under foot and forced to kiss the
shamrock-spangled sod of Erin;’ but all I
have now to remark about the members of that
Church is, they have nothing in the present
to complain of, and are quite at liberty to
commence taking that ell which is popularly
supposed to be the next step after receiving an
inch. I have no particular prejudice against
the Pope, or his clergy, or his followers myself,
but I think that part of the population
which Mr. Hanlon’s ‘stalwart peasantry, their
country’s pride,’ call the ‘Papishers,’ will take
one ell—probably many.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace sat quite still and silent. This, she
said to herself, was the reasoning the friends
of Ireland had to listen to and bear patiently.
Well, Ireland’s time would come. In the
meanwhile, the speaker was her father. Although
he, being English, could not possibly
understand anything about Ireland, still she,
Grace, could not argue with and contradict
him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“The next grievance stated,” went on Mr.
Moffat, “is that the English look down on the
Irish. Now, may I not inquire whether that
feeling be entirely one-sided? Do not the Irish
look down on the English? Have I not heard
ridicule directed to their ‘mincing talk,’ to
their ‘cutting away’ of words, to their drawl,
their airs, their notions, the whole tirade
ending, ‘But what else can be expected from
foreigners?’ Going down to the lower orders,
it is generally supposed few Englishmen ever
sound an ‘H’ in its place, or fail to put one in
where it is not wanted. I have laughed over
and over again at such ideas, but it certainly
never occurred to me that the ignorance in
which they originated was a grievance. Further,
English cleanliness is an offence, ‘What
a dirthy people to nade so much washing!’ is
a neat way of putting the Irish prejudice into
a nutshell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pray stop; pray do;” Grace cried; “we
do not agree, we cannot—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not? I was going on to say that,
if I may be allowed to make a bull, all England’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>best men have been Irishmen; in England
they have made their mark, and England has
not been chary of recognizing their merits.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She dare not!” exclaimed Grace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We won’t go into that question,” said Mr.
Moffat calmly. “It is natural enough when
gangs of imperfectly-clothed, strange-tongued,
foul-mouthed, ill-looking, unkempt, unwashed
Irish sweepings go over to the English harvest,
a highly-civilized community, though
composed of the lower orders, should—not comprehending
that these gangs are the very dregs
of the population—think but little of the bulk,
judging from the sample; but the upper classes,
better informed, look to the higher specimens,
and judge accordingly—judge of the capabilities
of the Irish on much too exalted a
scale.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you?” interrupted his daughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I try to hold the scales even, but find
it hard work. If O’Connell were to present a
glass which could not flatter to the face of
his countrymen, even he would find they and
their circumstances capable of presenting some
very ugly features.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“I love and respect that man!” cried
Grace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, my dear, so far as I am concerned,
I have no objection to your doing both. He
certainly is a very wonderful man; whether
he is a great one cannot be determined yet,
those who live to see the end will know.
Meanwhile I have nothing else to answer
except the misery, the distress, the poverty.
All are—why, we cannot tell with any certainty.
You talk of England: there are hundreds,
thousands of people in London even,
who would not let a dog want if they knew
it, and yet in wretched garrets men, willing
to work, die; into the cold rivers women,
unwilling to face the last alternative, throw
themselves, as though death were a friend
tried and trusted. Do you think there is any
place on the face of this earth where misery,
distress, poverty, are not? I have never seen
it; I do not expect ever to see it. Indeed, I
consider Kingslough singularly exempt from
the common epidemic of chronic and unrelieved
poverty. The poverty is, but the relief is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>also—often foolishly given—like yours,
Grace.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Like mine, papa?” and Mistress Grace
fired up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Like yours, my dear,” he answered calmly.
“But for you, and such as you, the paupers
would work or go into the poorhouse. They
say, ‘God’s mercies are better than the house.’
Translated from their glib language the phrase
means, ‘What we can beg, threaten, or steal,
is better than that we receive as a right by
line and plummet. The casual halfpenny,
with the wind blowing free about our exposed
persons, is sweeter than stir-about served in
a house, where we are expected to conform to
rules.’ Let me go through your annuitants.
First comes that patriarchal and religious gentleman
who, if he could be transported to
London, would make his own fortune as a
model, and the fortune of any artist who painted
him. His is a splendid and a venerable
presence, is it not? He might be an Irish
Melanchthon—on canvas. His head is worn
bare by taking off his hat. He impresses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>the beholder with the idea of former respectability
and of present sanctity. He
can quote the Scriptures with marvellous
fluency, and has a text ready for every
occasion. His talk is of another world, and
when he sees a fitting opportunity he bestows
the penny just dropped into his hat on some
one who, to use his own expression, ‘wants it
worse than himself.’ He is a prince amongst
beggars—a cross between an archbishop and
an emperor. Now suppose we trace his
career.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know what you are going to say, papa,
but, it is not true. I am certain it cannot be!”
exclaimed Grace vehemently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is quite true. His father had one of
those small freehold farms which are amongst
the misfortunes of this country. He did little
himself, and he brought up his two sons to do
less. Nevertheless when he died, one of the
two, not our venerable friend, but his brother,
worked on his land after the prevailing fashion.
He tickled the soil, he went through a
pantomime of manuring it. He sowed seed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>which produced miserable crops, though better
than could have been expected. In due time
the brother died, and then, while his supposed
grief lay heavy on him, the neighbours said,
‘It’s is plantin’ time, Barney; arn’t ye goin’ to
put in the corn and the praties?’ Solemnly
Barney answered, ‘The Lord will provide.’
Thinking him crazy with trouble, the kindly-foolish
people ploughed his acres, and bringing
their seed potatoes and their seed corn, set and
sowed for the gentleman within doors. Further,
having a certain interest and pride in the
matter, ‘consate’ as they call the feeling, they
moulded the potatoes, and dug them up; they
reaped the corn and thrashed it. Nothing
could have been found to please our friend
better. He thanked them in his best manner,
lived off the produce they had garnered for
him, and spent the winter not unpleasantly.
Seed-time came again, but the people did not
quite see their way to providing and planting
once more, so the land lay untilled, the fields
yielded no increase. He sold his cow, his
horse, his pigs, his fowls; he sold the furniture,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>his farm, his house; he lived on the money
thus procured so long as it lasted. When it
was gone he took to begging, and he has gone
on begging ever since, with a brief interval,
when he tried ‘the house.’ One day, while
in residence there, he saw some bundles of
new spades arrive. Foreseeing what that
portended, he left, and returned to his old
haunts and his old occupation, and was sufficiently
fortunate to please a young lady, who,
charmed by his acquaintance with Scripture,
actually settled a pension upon him. Then
there are your three idiots, who, harmless
though they may be, ought never to be allowed
to go roaming about the country, frightening
children into fits, and disgusting every one
who has not a fellow-feeling for the ‘naturals.’
That deaf and dumb girl you encourage is a
perfect nuisance to the neighbourhood, making
believe to tell fortunes and to prophesy, in
her hideous gibberish, good or evil. As for
the women, Grace, I don’t like to speak as I
feel about them. Harmless, toothless old hags
they seem to you, no doubt, shivering with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>cold, barefooted, scantily dressed, with a
tattered patchwork quilt covering their
shoulders; but, so far as I am concerned,
rather than meet one of them I would make a
<i><span lang="fr">détour</span></i> of a mile any day. But, there, I will
not vex you any more. We do not agree on
this matter, and I see no chance of our ever
doing so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are agreed on one point, I am sure,”
said Grace slowly, “they are poor—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are certainly not millionaires.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And we have comparative wealth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We should not be wealthy long if their
wishes were gratified.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And being rich,” went on Grace, unheeding,
“I fancy we ought to help those who
are poor. They may be lazy, and dirty, and
deceitful, and wicked, very possibly they are;
but when I lie awake at night, warm and snug,
I do not think the remembrance of their sinfulness
would make me feel more comfortable if,
through any fault of mine, they were sleeping
on the bare ground, with the stars looking
down upon them, and not a morsel to put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>in their lips when the day broke. The system
may be bad, and the people too, but I did not
make either, and I would fain be of use to
somebody, if I can.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are a good girl, Grace,” answered her
father, “and if it be a pleasure to you to
give, give; it would be no pleasure to me, and
so I refrain. To show you, however, that I
want to please you, I repeat, if your eloquence
fail to touch the possible future earl, I will see
whether I can do anything. By the way,
Grace, we see little, comparatively, of Mr.
Somerford now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose he is studying how he shall bear
his new dignities when they are thrust upon
him,” said Miss Moffat a little bitterly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you heard that Lady Glendare was
extremely anxious for her son to marry?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Impossible!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perfectly possible; she found the young
lady, too. But his lordship seemed, so Dillwyn
tells me, to consider there had been
sufficient division in the family; in a word,
he does not think the idea of disappointing his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>cousin so entrancing a one as it might have
appeared formerly. Further, the bride he is
bound to will not hear of disappointment, so
Mr. Somerford may awake any morning and
find himself one step nearer the earldom of
Glendare.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will have much in his power;” that
was all Grace said or meant to say about
the matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not quite sure of that,” replied
her father, “the property is frightfully encumbered.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But a few years of retrenchment and
good management would work a great change
in the state of affairs,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will have to be wrought by some
one not a Somerford, or I am greatly mistaken,”
said Mr. Moffat, and then Grace understood
that Mr. Dillwyn had been depreciating
Robert Somerford to her parent.</p>

<p class='c010'>A few days later she felt disposed to depreciate
him to herself. Walking back from
Kingslough she met the possible earl riding
towards the town. At sight of her he dismounted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and, leading his horse, retraced
part of his way in her company.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had wished to see him, and said so
frankly; she wanted to speak about Amos
Scott, and ascertain if anything could be
done for him, and if so, what? She spoke
of the great trouble which had come to her
humble friend, spoke out of the fulness of
her heart of the wrong he had sustained, of
the misery he was suffering, of all the
wretchedness she feared might arise from the
affair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Such cases have been, unhappily, not uncommon,”
said Mr. Somerford. “It is no
wonder a judgment has fallen on our
race.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you come into the title you will
try to put all the wrong right,” she said
eagerly, forgetting herself—forgetting him, as
she thought of Amos Scott, and others in a
like predicament, who had been left homeless
through the carelessness or wickedness of the
Glendares.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If ever I am Earl of Glendare,” he replied,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>in a tone which told Grace the full extent
of the error she had committed, “If ever I
have the misfortune to be Earl of Glendare, I
expect I shall find everything wrong, and
nothing left wherewith to put wrong right.
As to Scott, I know not what to say or to do.
I will talk the matter over with Dillwyn, and,
if anything can be done, I will write to you or
call.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She had gone so far, that she felt disposed
to go a little farther. She would put affairs
upon some different footing, let the consequences
be what they would, let her companion
think what he chose.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have not had the pleasure of seeing
much of you lately,” she said in a tone
studiously careless, though her voice almost
trembled as she uttered the words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been scarcely my own master since
Henry went away,” he replied. “The fact
is—” but there he stopped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did not complete your sentence, I
think,” she said, after an instant’s pause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it was an awkward sentence, one I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>ought not perhaps to have begun; but the
fact is, my time is so little at my own disposal;
my position is now so different from
what it was formerly—that—you are so
clever, Miss Moffat, I am certain you understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not particularly clever,” she retorted;
“but I fancy I understand, and I will speak
more plainly than you. We, my father and I,
made you welcome to come to Bayview; we
now make you equally welcome to stay away.
Good morning, Mr. Somerford,” and, with a
slight curtsey, Grace left him, as greatly disconcerted
a gentleman as any gentleman who
has got what he wanted, but not in the way
he wanted it, could possibly be.</p>

<p class='c010'>For Grace, she was like one who, receiving
a wound in the heat of battle, feels neither
ache nor pain. She was in such a tempest of
passion, that she could not tell where she was
hurt, or whether she was hurt at all. A man
had trodden her pride under foot. She
had been jilted, and that by Robert Somerford!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='large'>BY THE SAD SEA WAVES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Times goes on, whether people are glad or
sorry, sick or well, rich or poor, and it never
paused for a moment, although Miss Grace
Moffat was mortified beyond expression because
a man had served her as she had served
Mr. John Riley.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fast and loose is a game at which people
only like to play when they are the winners.
It had been a small matter in the opinion of
the girl Grace to discard a lover. Seven years
later it seemed no small matter for a lover to
discard her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>It is a curious thing to consider how rarely
in matters of great or little importance men
and women are able to avenge themselves,
and yet how surely retribution is compassed
for them by others. Thousands of miles distant,
John Riley never dreamed his lost love
was receiving from Mr. Somerford the same
measure she had meted to him. Grace, as
was natural, felt very indignant about the
matter, but it never occurred to her that it
had been rather nice of John Riley not to feel
anger against her in the days that could never
come back.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not a pleasant experience, but I am
very certain that she was the better for it; that
the heiress, who found her money could not
buy everything for her, could no more prevent
slights being put upon her than if she were
a girl without a sixpence, was much improved
by the discovery.</p>

<p class='c010'>In affairs of the heart, when their own is
not touched, women are as instinctively cruel
to men as children to insects, perhaps for the
same reason; and if the lesson which makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>them “feel too” be sharp, it is nevertheless
better for them to understand that what may
seem fun to their ignorance is death to their
victims.</p>

<p class='c010'>The blow to Grace’s pride was so severe
that it almost deadened the pain of the wound
received by her fancy. I use the word
advisedly, for her heart had never been very
deeply concerned in the matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Robert Somerford never was to her what
Daniel Brady had been to poor Nettie. She
never loved him with an absorbing attachment;
if she had, however, that love must indeed be
remarkable which can subsist for years on
hope and expectancy. People may marry
after a probation of this kind, as they may
marry after a long engagement, but the probability
is that the final wooing and wedding
will prove a somewhat prosaic affair.</p>

<p class='c010'>No; now the scales were removed from her
eyes, Grace Moffat knew she had never cared
for Robert Somerford as she understood a girl
should care for the man she intended to take as
husband. She had been dazzled by his good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>looks, his accomplishments, his manners, his
rank, his prospects. She had felt as the poor
people around her would have said that she
was “getting value for her money.” Oh,
that money! In the first bitterness of her
disappointment Grace wished she had not
a penny. “Then perhaps somebody might
care for me for myself,” she thought, as if John
Riley had not cared more for her little finger
than for all her fortune.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, then, she did not care for John Riley,
which made the difference.</p>

<p class='c010'>One mortification, however, Miss Moffat was
spared. The world (that is to say, her world)
never knew exactly how the matter stood,
for the home thrust she administered had only
the effect of bringing Mr. Somerford as a more
frequent visitor to her father’s house. He
wrote Grace a note, complaining of how
utterly she had misjudged him, and declaring
that till the last hour of his life he could never
forget Bayview; the dear friends who lived
there; the happy hours he had spent beneath
its roof. What he said was specious enough,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and Grace, wise in her generation, and mindful
always of what “Kingslough might think,”
accepted his explanation.</p>

<p class='c010'>But she knew perfectly well that she had
not misinterpreted his meaning; and he knew
this. Perhaps because he did know it, he
came to the house more frequently, feeling
relieved at the idea that now Grace could not
expect him to propose for her, and yet with a
vague idea that at some future period he
might ask her to marry him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But for his expectations he would have
asked her to do so long before. He was very
fond of her, but he was not one half so fond
of her as of himself. Never had he liked her
better than when she said he could stay away.
There was a spirit and a directness, and a
comprehension about her swift retort which
gave a piquancy to the transaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>And he liked to think no one knew, no one
would ever know, anything about it excepting
they two. He felt satisfied she would
feel as little desire to speak of that short
skirmish as he. They understood each other,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>and the only drawback to the pleasure of her
society he had ever felt was removed. Altogether
it was as well she had spoken; altogether
Grace acknowledged it was better he
should still visit at Bayview.</p>

<p class='c010'>But she could never care for him again.
Hero in her eyes he might never seem more.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was at this period he would have talked
to Mr. Dillwyn concerning Amos Scott’s
affairs, had that gentleman not told him he
declined to meddle in the transaction, that there
was nothing to be done about the matter, that
if the old earl rose from the dead he could not
give Scott the promised lease, and that, in fine,
there was no use in discussing the question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you believe your uncle had the man’s
money, and feel any desire to repay the
amount—pay it,” finished Mr. Dillwyn;
“but neither you nor anybody else, except
Brady, can give him a longer term of the
Castle Farm, and Brady won’t give it to
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You think not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure not!” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Nevertheless Mr. Somerford rode over to
Maryville in the hope of affecting Mr. Brady’s
heart by his powers of persuasion. But Mr.
Brady was firm. He would only, so he
declared, have been too glad to accede to Mr.
Somerford’s request had the land been any
other land than the Castle Farm, and the
man any other man than Amos Scott.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I were to give in to him now,” he said,
“I might leave Maryville. He would regard
my concession as an act of weakness; he
would be setting himself up in opposition
against me at every turn. I should have no
peace of my life. It really grieves me, Mr.
Somerford, to have to refuse a request coming
from one of your family, and more particularly
as I understand Miss Moffat is also interested
in the matter. But if you put yourself in my
place, you will see, I think, how utterly impossible
it is for me to do what you ask.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All of which, and many other regrets, and
apologies and excuses, Mr. Somerford repeated
to Miss Moffat, who, thanks to the
fresh light thrown across his character, understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>perfectly that if the earl’s nephew had
stood in Mr. Brady’s shoes, he would most likely
have acted in a somewhat similar manner.
As indeed why should he not?</p>

<p class='c010'>Even Grace would have been unable to say
with authority that Mr. Brady ought to give
up his rights for any other reason than because
“it was such a pity of poor Amos,”
and this sentiment, although pretty coming
from a woman’s lips, would scarcely, I imagine,
satisfy a jury as to the justice of a man’s
claim. Undoubtedly it was a pity of poor
Amos; but then, as Mr. Dillwyn remarked,
he had no one to thank for his misfortunes
except himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amos, on the contrary, thought every one
was to blame for his misfortunes except himself,
and Mr. Brady he regarded as the chief
of the offenders, because, knowing Scott
wanted the farm, he had gone and taken it
“over his head.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall fight it out with you,” said Scott,
shaking his fist in Mr. Brady’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well,” answered Mr. Brady, “I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>content.” And it required no seer to tell
what the end of the matter would be as regarded
the Scotts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile, however, a strong feeling was
developing itself against Mr. Brady. Popular
opinion, which in other places besides Ireland
generally rears itself in opposition to law,
considered Scott had been hardly done by—that
“Brady had taken an advantage of him,”—that
“he knew well enough the decent man
had paid his savings honestly come by, to
the earl”—that the “Castle Farm could be
no more to him nor any other farm,” and that
“he might have taken the sum Mr. Moffat
offered him to let Scott and his wife and the
boys and girls stay on in the old home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it’s himself is the hard man,” said
even the beggars, when rehearsing Mr. Brady’s
sins of omission and commission.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ it’ll come home to him yet,” chorused
dozens of self-constituted partisans, for it was
a noticeable fact in the affair that Mr. Brady
was the person on whose head all the vials of
righteous wrath were poured.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>As for the earl, “In course a gentleman
like him had plenty to think about; and it
was no miracle, with all the trouble he had
on him, that Scott’s lease should have slipped
his memory.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was some truth in this view of the
question, and it was a natural view, at all
events to a nation who probably never will
be induced to understand that as much evil
may be wrought through carelessness as
through set purpose, that the indifference of
selfishness may curse as many lives as the
deliberate plotting of a clever schemer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Be this as it may, however, people were
beginning to take sides in the matter. One
party considered Scott ought to be supported;
another, though perfectly indifferent to his
opponent, thought Brady was entitled to enter
into possession.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The law is clear enough in the case,” said
Lord Ardmorne, “and those who are inciting
the poor fellow to resist the law, are doing him
but a sorry kindness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wherein the marquis was quite correct,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>only he overlooked the fact that Scott was
quite ready to resist the law without any
incitement from his fellows. Further, if such
a paradox be admissible, he believed the law
to be on his side; that is, he was looking out
for a solicitor whom he could persuade to be of
his opinion. Somewhere on the earth justice
would be done him, if not in one court, why
in another.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man was unreasonable, mad if you
will; but Mr. Brady, as he imagined, was
trying to despoil him of the labour of years,
the fruits of his toil, and it is not alone in
Ireland that people who fancy they have been
ruined without any fault of their own are
irrational and implacable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides, he had a vague idea that if he
could pour the tale of his wrongs into the ears
of the proper person, Brady might be worsted,
and he righted; and there is perhaps nothing
more difficult to combat than a conviction,
decided, though formless, of this kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for Grace, she was growing sick at heart
of the whole business. All her sympathies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>were with Scott and his family, but she had
sense enough to see there could be only one
end to the course the farmer had elected to
tread—ruin; and sometimes she could not
help agreeing in her father’s openly-expressed
opinion that the best thing which could now
occur at the Castle Farm would be for Amos
to take a fever and die, and so leave the
mother and children free to quit the place,
and let those who were willing to help them
do so.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was whilst things were in this unsatisfactory
state that Mr. Hanlon one day brought
Grace a note from Mrs. Brady. He presented
it with formal politeness, saying he had been
asked to give it in private into Miss Moffat’s
own hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you not read it?” he asked, as
Grace held the letter unopened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does Mrs. Brady wish me to return an
answer by you?” was the reply spoken coldly
enough, for Miss Moffat by no means
approved of the messenger chosen by her
old friend.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“No; as I understand the matter, that
note only contains a request which Mrs.
Brady is sure you will comply with. She
had no other means,” he went on hurriedly,
“of sending to you: she was afraid of the
letter miscarrying in any way, of it falling by
mischance into her husband’s possession.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did she tell you so?” Grace inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are some things, Miss Moffat, one
knows by intuition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace broke the seal and read the few lines
Nettie had traced; then, turning to Mr.
Hanlon, she said, “Do you know by intuition
the contents of this note?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I gathered from a few words Mrs. Brady
let fall that she wishes to see you,” he replied
ignoring the ironical repetition of his own
remark contained in Miss Moffat’s inquiry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know why she wishes to see me?”
Grace persisted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not,” was the reply. Then more
earnestly, “I assure you, on my honour, I
have not the slightest idea—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Hanlon,” Grace began, “I always was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>I always shall be, attached to Mrs. Brady; but I
do not like commencing any correspondence with
her which involves mystery and secrecy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That I can well understand; but from
what I have seen of Mrs. Brady you may
be certain she has some sufficient reason
for her request; from what I have seen of
Mr. Brady, it might be perilous for her
openly to disobey his commands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perilous!” exclaimed Grace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I use the word advisedly—and—confidentially,”
he answered. “It may be,” he
went on, “that in meeting Mrs. Brady as
she asks, you may be doing her a great service.
In any case you cannot be doing her an unkindness,
for she is very lonely and—very
unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace did not reply, she took up Nettie’s
note and read it over once more:</p>

<p class='c010'>“This evening soon after dusk, I shall be
at the Lone Rock. I want to speak to you;
meet me there. <em>Be sure you do.</em> Burn this
note, and say nothing about it to any one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When she had finished, she said,—</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“You are going back to Maryville, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I may not perhaps be there again for
weeks, unless, indeed, you wish me to convey
a message to Mrs. Brady.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not a matter of any consequence,”
was the reply; “I only wanted to let her know
I would do as she asks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That I think she expected,” he said; and
then, having completed his mission, and finding
that the conversation languished, Mr.
Hanlon took his leave.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be difficult to say why Miss Moffat
shrank from the idea of the interview suggested
by Nettie. Had Mrs. Brady proposed coming
to Bayview, Grace would have welcomed her
with open arms; but she distrusted mysteries.
She could not help remembering all the evil
Nettie’s secret ways of proceeding had wrought
in the days gone by, and she could not endure
being a party to a clandestine meeting, the
note appointing which was brought to her, of
all people in the world, by Mr. Hanlon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instinct in most women is a truer guide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>than reason, and instinctively Grace felt that
Nettie’s note portended trouble; that her
choice of a messenger was indiscreet; that matters
at Maryville were even worse than most
people imagined; and that time, instead of drawing
Mr. Brady and his wife closer together,
was widening the breach that had been made
when injudicious but well-meaning friends
forced Nettie on a man who was but half-willing
to marry her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must try to gain her confidence,” thought
Grace, as though after seven years she could
hope to win a trust which Nettie then withheld.
Mrs. Brady had never confided in any
one. It was not likely she intended to change
her tactics now.</p>

<p class='c010'>The grounds at Bayview extended to the
seashore. At high tide the trees spread their
branches over the water, and when storms
were fierce and the waves came rolling in,
the long gravel-walk on the top of the sloping
bank was impassable. In calm weather, however,
the place gave one the idea of utter peace
and repose, and Grace had always been fond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>of wandering upon the shore, looking now
away to the open sea, and again to the soft
green hills, with Kingslough nestling under
their shadow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not a stone, not a tree, not an effect of sun
and shade, not an illusion of twilight, not a
fairy touch of moonlight, but was familiar to
Grace; and as she neared the Lone Rock in the
growing darkness of a still summer’s evening
her accustomed eye saw a figure leaning against
the stone, which came forward to meet her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nettie!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Grace!” That was all; then they sat
down, hand clasped in hand, and kept silence
for a minute.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was broken by Nettie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I knew you would come,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.” Grace could not find it in her heart
to speak the words she had intended, at least
not then.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps you thought it strange my not
going to Bayview?” resumed Nettie; “but I
dare not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?” asked the other.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“In the first place, because Mr. Brady
never would have forgiven me if I had; in the
next, because he would have wanted to know
what I could have to say to you.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And supposing he had?” Grace inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I have told you, there will be no
need to suppose how he would feel about the
matter,” replied Nettie shortly. “Before,
however, I get to that part of my story, I
want to say something. When I was first
married, I felt your not coming to see me
very keenly. I was bitter against you; I am
not bitter now. I am glad you never entered
Maryville; you were right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is a point on which I have never
been able to satisfy myself,” said Grace sadly.
“I did not want to desert you, Nettie, but
I could not run counter to the wishes and
desires of all my friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will leave your friends and their
wishes out of the question,” was the answer.
“I tell you I am glad. I say it was right for
you to have done with me. It was I who deserted
you; it was I who, without counting the
cost, gave all for love and the world well lost.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“I cannot ask you questions which might
pain you,” said Grace; “but anything you like
to tell me, do, though I am almost afraid to
hear what your married life has been.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You need not be afraid, for you will never
hear, neither you nor anybody else,” Nettie
replied. “I have borne, and I can bear. No
human being knows what I have borne but
myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a little catching sob, and then
she proceeded,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Grace, you must never let any one
suspect how you got to know what I am
going to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps you ought not to tell me?” suggested
Miss Moffat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will be able to judge better about
that when you know what it is,” retorted her
companion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I do not like having to keep secrets,”
Grace pleaded, “I never did all my life; they
are always productive of anxiety, or misery,
or shame.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t talk nonsense!” exclaimed Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Brady; “people must have secrets, and they
must hear and tell them too sometimes. The
matter I have to speak about does not concern
me, though it concerns people in whose prosperity
you ought to feel interested.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you mean the Scotts?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I do not mean the Scotts; I mean a
family who will find themselves in a worse
position than the Scotts some day, if they
are not wise in time. If John Riley were
at home, I should not have troubled you about
the matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What has John Riley to do with it?”
asked Grace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just this much: you know Woodbrook is
heavily mortgaged? of course you do, that
was one reason why you would not marry
John.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nettie!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is of no use interrupting me in that
ridiculous manner,” said Mrs. Brady pettishly.
“If John had been a rich man, I believe you
would have married him; but as he was only a
poor, honest fellow, with a plain face, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>loved you with all his heart and soul, you sent
him adrift, and let him go to India, where I
hope he may make a fortune, and come home,
and meet with some good, sensible girl, richer
than ever you were. Yes, you may take away
your hand; I did not come here to-night to
flatter you, be sure of that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What did you come for?” asked Miss
Moffat; “do not beat about the bush, and talk
of all sorts of irrelevant matters, but tell me in
a word what it is you want to say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a word, then, you know Woodbrook is
mortgaged?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; it has always been so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know who holds that mortgage?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I once heard, but I have forgotten the
name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think you could remember it if
I told you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If any good purpose were to be served
by my recollection, I would try,” answered
Grace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, the mortgage is really held by
Mr. Daniel Brady of Maryville.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“You are not serious?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Am I not? The Rileys may find it a
very serious matter to them, whatever you
may think.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But how could he hold the mortgage
without the General being aware of the
fact?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot tell you, for I do not know
myself. All I am able to say, he does hold
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you quite certain?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As certain as that we are sitting here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“From whom did you hear this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“From Mr. Brady’s own lips.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what does he say about it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He never said a word to me concerning
the affair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I thought you heard from his own lips
that he held the mortgage?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I did, but he was not talking to
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To whom was he talking?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To his lawyer, and I was listening: and
if he knew I had listened, he would kill me—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>is,” added Nettie reflectively, “if he was
not afraid of being hung.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why should he mind your knowing
about it?” Grace asked with a shiver.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why should he mind your knowing about
it? why should he mind the General knowing?”
inquired Nettie contemptuously.
“Because if once the Rileys’ eyes were
opened, they would move heaven and earth
to pay the interest regularly, or to pay off
the mortgage altogether. If they do not do
this, he will own Woodbrook yet, as surely as
he owns the Castle Farm now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What can be done?” said Grace helplessly;
“do you think I ought to go to the
General?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure you ought to do nothing of the
kind,” answered Nettie. “He is an old man,
and he never was a very wise one. Do you
ever write to John?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a shame! If I had not liked him
well enough for a husband, I would have tried
to keep him as a friend.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“Surely we need not talk of that now?”
suggested Grace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Hartley has not given him up, I
suppose?” said Nettie, unheeding the interruption.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She hears from him frequently,” was the
answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But then you never see her,” remarked
Mrs. Brady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She often asks me to go to England, but I
always refuse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Home attractions are so great,” said Nettie
demurely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am very fond of my home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you still very fond of something
else, or, to speak more correctly, of somebody
else?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not exactly understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you intend to marry Mr. Somerford or
not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be time enough for me to answer
that question when he asks me it himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish you would answer me though,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Grace,” said Mrs. Brady earnestly. “When
Robert Somerford asks you to be his wife,
what reply shall you make?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He may never put such a question,”
answered Grace, with an uneasy laugh, “so
what is the use of talking about it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will put just such a question before
very long,” persisted Mrs. Brady; “you are
neither a child nor a very foolish girl any
more. You are a year older than I am, and I
feel as if I had lived a century at least. Tell
me truly what answer you will return; do tell
me, Grace, for the sake of the days when you
loved me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I love you still, Nettie!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Impatiently Mrs. Brady turned aside the
remark.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not want to know whether you love
me or not. What can that signify how? I
want to know if you mean to marry Mr.
Somerford when he asks you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you know he ever means to do
so?” said Grace evasively.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will tell you when you have replied to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>my question. Will you say ‘yes’ or
‘no.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In that entirely suppositious case I should
say ‘No.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really and truly?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really and truly I shall never be more
to him than I am now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Notwithstanding his handsome face!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not if he were ten times handsomer
than he is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is going to act extremely handsomely
by you,” said Nettie, picking up a pebble and
throwing it out into the sea as far as she could.
“He means to propose to Miss Middleton, and
when she refuses him, as she will do, he
intends to ask you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a matter-of-fact coolness about
this statement which took away Miss Moffat’s
breath. Finding she made no comment, her
friend continued, “I heard that, also, the other
evening. Miss Middleton is the daughter of
a great English brewer, who has bought an
estate near Kilcurragh; but her father will not
hear of the match. Some one has been prejudicing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>him against Mr. Robert, so you see
the gentleman will fall between the two
stools.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It does not matter to either you or me
where he falls,” said Grace hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not much certainly,” agreed Mrs. Brady.
“And now that I have told you my news, I
will go home again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not go yet!” entreated Miss Moffat.
“Tell me what I ought to do about the
General.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your own sense will tell you that,” Nettie
answered; “only, Grace, on whatever course
you may decide, keep my name out of the
affair. Never let any one suspect you heard
of it from me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you not afraid of trusting Mr.
Hanlon?” asked her friend gently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not trust him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he knew you wished to see me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; but nothing more. He does not
know anything from me, though, of course, he
cannot avoid seeing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What does he see, dear?” asked Grace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>replying rather to the quiver in Nettie’s voice
than to the words she spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is no matter,” was the answer, and the
sentence sounded almost like a sob.</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace’s arms were about her neck; Grace’s
tears were on her cheek. “Nettie darling, am
I not the nearest friend you ever had? cannot
you trust me with your trouble, whatever it
may be?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gently and sorrowfully Nettie unclasped the
twining arms, and put away the lips which
were pressed to hers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is no matter,” she repeated; “I do not
want to talk of myself at all. I must go now,
Grace, I must indeed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And she rose as she spoke, and drawing her
dark shawl closely about her slight figure,
pressed Grace’s hand in token of farewell.</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace held her hand tight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When shall I see you again?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sometime perhaps—perhaps never,” was
the reply. “Sometime, Grace, when you are
happily married and have a tribe of bairns
about you, or are a rich old maid with no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>bairns at all, I may ask you to give a helping
hand to my children. It is the thought of
them that breaks my heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You lost one!” Grace said pityingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two,” corrected Nettie, “and sometimes
I wish I had lost them all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must not speak in that way, dear!”
expostulated Grace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it,” was the reply, “and so I do
not want to speak.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you let me come and see you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, <em>never</em>,” said Nettie decidedly. “There
is only one thing you can do for me now, and
that is save the Rileys. I think Mrs. Hartley
will find a way to do it. At all events she can
warn John. He did the best he could for me
once, and I should not like to see his father
and mother and sisters beggars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why should Mr. Brady want to
beggar them?” asked Grace, who could not
yet grasp the full meaning and importance
of all Nettie had told her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He hates them,” was the answer, spoken
calmly and evenly. “He hates everybody, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>think, but he has an especial aversion to the
Rileys, because they made him marry
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were married to him before they
interfered.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not so sure of that; I shall never know
for a certainty whether the first ceremony,
if one could call it a ceremony, was legal.
In any case, but for the Rileys, he could have
turned round some day and told me it was
valueless. Besides that, the General and
John were not very civil to him, and none of
the family ever took any notice of me after—after—I
left my aunt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Scant causes to produce such great results!”
said Miss Moffat reflectively.</p>

<p class='c010'>“More than sufficient, however,” answered
Nettie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Brady must be very rich,” remarked
Grace after a moment’s silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is not rich; he is poor, he will always
be poor; but he has the command of money,
he knows people ready to advance it. I suppose
if you and I wanted to raise money for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>any good purpose, we should not be able to
get it, but if we desired it to compass any evil,
I do not doubt but we should have more than
we could use.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You seem to entertain some nice comfortable
theories concerning life,” said Grace,
trying to speak cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have no theories,” answered Mrs. Brady.
“Everything with me resolves itself into
practice. I used to have dreams and fancies,
but I have none now, except one which haunts
me night and day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind, it may come true or it may
not. I wonder, Grace,” she suddenly added,
“what you and I will be doing seven years
hence, if we live so long?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you will be happier, Nettie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never said I was unhappy, did I?”
asked the young wife. “Some people are
born to be very happy, I suppose, and some—are
not so fortunate. It was not such a bright
fortune which lay before me when I was a
girl, that I need lament over my present lot.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>I have not everything I should like, it is true,
but I do not complain; no one ever heard me
complain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would rather hear you complain, Nettie,
than talk in the way you have done to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! that is because you do not know,
because you cannot understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She was gone. Grace would have followed,
but she waved her back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must not come with me,” she said.
“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly and mournfully the waves rippled
in on the sands as Grace Moffat walked homeward,
her thoughts intent on Nettie and her
extraordinary confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the statement she had made were true,
and it was impossible to doubt its accuracy,
then Mr. Brady intended to oust the Rileys
out of Woodbrook, as he proposed to turn
the Scotts out of the Castle Farm.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Nettie had said, it does not require so
much money to compass evil as it does to
effect good. It is easier to ruin a man than
to establish his fortunes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Mortgaging in Ireland was not in those days
so unusual a thing as to induce general ignorance
concerning its possible, and probable results;
and although Mr. Moffat had never borrowed
a shilling, never forestalled his income
by an hour, still Grace had heard enough of
monetary embarrassments among her acquaintances
to understand tolerably well what
“foreclosing” would mean on the Woodbrook
estates.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her own fortune, it may be remembered,
had at one time been destined to redeeming
that mortgage, and giving ease to a family
who had never known the meaning of the
word: but when she refused Mr. Riley, of
course his relatives had relapsed into their old
state of embarrassment, which was, however,
in their eyes relieved by John’s letters and
John’s remittances from India. If, therefore,
the interest were accumulating, if the
indebtedness were increasing, if Mr. Brady
were the real mortgagee, Grace, without any
gift of second sight, could see the end which
must come ere long, unless steps to avert the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>catastrophe could be taken, and that without
delay.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the sea rippled in over the sands, and the
scent of the flowers and shrubs floated on the
air as they had done that night when she
refused her first lover, and sent him out into
the world to seek such fortune as the world
had in store for him.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='large'>WHAT THE WAVES WHISPERED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There is no sadder sound in nature than the
plashing of the waves on a lonely shore in the
twilight of a calm evening. As nothing more
mournful can well be seen than an expanse of
sand stretching away to the far-out tide under
the first glimpse of light, so there is something
melancholy beyond expression in that perpetually
recurring sob with which the sea
flings itself upon the land.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sound is not soothing because it is intermittent,
and the ear aches with waiting for
its return. It lacks the fury of tempest, and
consequently fails to kindle the imagination.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Not even the soughing of autumn winds
amongst the trees is so plaintive and depressing
as the moaning of the sea. One could almost
fancy that spirits haunted the shore, and kept
weeping and making lamentations bitter,
though low. The cry of the bittern cutting
through the night is weird and sorrowful
enough, but it does not sink the soul with such
a burden of utter depression as that caused by
the long drawn-out sigh of the quiet sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are special times and particular moods
of mind when, even to those who love the
ocean best, the monotonous lament I have tried
to describe becomes almost unendurable. It
recalls unpleasant memories of the past, it
awakens dismal forebodings concerning the
future, it shadows the present with a mantle of
gloom, and it tinges every thought and recollection
with a touch of involuntary superstition.
In darkness and loneliness people grow fanciful
and imaginative. Provide melancholy with
a calm evening, a quiet shore, and the sea lapping
in upon the sands, and the solitary muser
becomes her victim with scarce a struggle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Melancholy, at all events, held Grace Moffat
captive as she walked slowly back from the
Lone Rock, thinking as she went.</p>

<p class='c010'>Given youth, beauty, health, fortune, should
not her thoughts have been pleasant? To all
outward appearance Grace Moffat had not a
care; and, in reality, any trouble she might
feel arose principally, if not entirely, from her
high ideal of life’s responsibilities, from her
intense sympathy with the sins, sorrows, and
perplexities of her fellow-creatures.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through the gathering darkness she sauntered
slowly homeward, and her thoughts
brooded thus: “Beauty! what does it profit?
Has it won for me a single true heart?
Wealth! what use have I made of it hitherto,
of what avail shall it prove in the future?
Youth! it passes away, it is gone in an hour;
whilst the soft green buds of April open into
leaf, behold May comes on us unawares; and
almost ere we can scent the perfume of the
hawthorn, June’s roses are blooming, have
bloomed, are dead. Friends! they die, they
change, they leave us. The plans and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>projects of life, they are either incapable of
fulfilment, or our power is not competent to
perfect them. The hopes, the dreams, the aspirations
of early spring are chilled, dispelled,
disappointed, ere the first breath of winter has
frosted over the fair landscape. And what is
left?” the girl reflected, pausing as she asked
the question.</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly and solemnly the waves swept in
upon the shore, and then, flinging out a wreath
of foam, retreated with a sob.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The whole creation groaneth and travaileth
in pain together,” Grace murmured.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was not free from the vice of quoting
half-texts of Scripture and fancifully adapting
them to personal impressions, which is the
speciality of young people, but from which
persons who are older and ought to know
better are often unable altogether to excuse
themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even the sea seemed to her imagination to
be in pain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the matter with me to-night, I
wonder?” she marvelled. It was not altogether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the long, slow sweep of the tide; it was
not the remembrance of an ideal existence still
unfulfilled, destined possibly never to be fulfilled,
it was something conceived by regret
and repentance which struggled within her
for expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tones of Nettie’s voice, full at times of
the bitterness of suppressed grief, at others of
the pathetic tenderness of unshed tears, of unspoken
suffering, had pierced Grace’s heart;
and, mingling with the feelings of impotent
regret which she expressed for the sorrow
golden-haired Annette had wrought for herself,
came other memories, of a man who had loved
her very dearly, in whose voice she had once
heard the same agony of repressed emotion,
who, in the gathering twilight, with the scent
of the flowers floating on the evening air, and
the sound of the waters creeping in upon the
shore, had received his final answer, and said
“Good-bye” and “God bless you, Grace!” in
the same breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, he had loved her; Grace felt Nettie
was right in this. Let her fortune have exercised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>as large an influence as it might, he must
have entertained perhaps as true an affection
for her as she had ever inspired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he has got over that long, long ago,”
she said to herself, with a faint, cynical smile
which the darkness concealed. “How will it
be with them all, though, if his father loses
Woodbrook?”</p>

<p class='c010'>How, indeed! Grace had already traced the
outlines of a picture, the grouped figures in
which and the grim accessories whereof filled
her with dismay. She had not evolved it altogether
out of the intricacies of her imagination,
for once upon a time she chanced to behold
a family party who might well enough
have sat for the Rileys of the possible future.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was before Mrs. Hartley left Kingslough,
when it struck that lady duty required
a visit to be paid to a certain Mrs. Wallace, of
whose hospitality she and the late Mr. Hartley
had partaken when the Wallaces lived near
Glenwellan. With that curious fancy for returning
to the scenes of bygone greatness which
is characteristic of those whose greatness has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>been of a limited and local description, the
family one summer decided on reuniting and
“taking the sea” at Kilcurragh. Thither
Mrs. Hartley invited Grace to accompany her;
and Grace, though she hated a covered car,
and that covered car a hired one, with a hatred
which can only be appreciated by those who
loathe that species of conveyance, consented.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Hartley, who would neither make use of
her friends’ carriages, nor keep one herself,
hired a car for the expedition, and on the way
entertained Grace with the exposition of those
practical ideas for which she was famous.</p>

<p class='c010'>First, she recited the glories of the Wallace
family. She rehearsed the horses they rode,
the carriages they drove, the servants they
employed, the hangers-on they maintained.
She described the dinners, where nothing was
lacking save solvency; the open house, which
provided everything for every one save peace
of mind for the owners.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor were the glories of “The Castle” forgotten;
the attire of Mrs. Wallace when she
attended successive parties at the absurd little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Dublin Court, more ridiculous in its way than
the courts of petty states abroad which have
only about five pounds a week of revenue to
maintain their magnificence, was duly described.
As beads and rum to the Indian squaws and
chiefs, so Dublin Castle to those Irish ladies
and gentlemen who could never hope to enter
Buckingham Palace; and the analogy had not
failed to strike so keen and bitter an observer
of Hibernian character as Mrs. Hartley.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But how did the ruin come about?” asked
Grace, wearying of the detestable sideway
motion of the car and her companion’s satire.
“What had these unhappy people done or left
undone that they should be poor as you say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did the ruin come about?” Mrs.
Hartley repeated, putting on her judicial look
and her black cap before pronouncing sentence
upon the sins and shortcomings of those “misguided
Irish Wallaces.” “My dear, how does
ruin come about? It comes through folly or
misfortune, or carelessness or thoughtlessness,
which are in England synonymous terms for
reckless hospitality, mad dissipation, unwarrantable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>expenditure, and utter selfishness.
In this country, which may some day be a
great and wonderful country, but not till it is
repeopled, re-religioned, recropped, rebuilt, and
remodelled, you have a somewhat coarse proverb
about foolish people who eat the calf out of a
cow. Grace, child, in Ireland everybody is
either starving the cow or eating the calf.
The Wallaces ate the calf, as the Somerfords
ate theirs, as fifty others I could name devoured
it, feet, head, and tail.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And they lost everything,” said Grace
sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They ate the calf, and then the cow, and
then the cow’s pasture,” Mrs. Hartley replied.
“They kept open house till after the bailiffs
came; they danced, feasted, dressed, kept up
an appearance to the last with a courage
worthy of a better cause; then came the collapse;
the girls were invited to stay ‘with
friends;’ the young men ‘got appointments;’
the father and mother went away for the
benefit of Mr. Wallace’s health. Then the
place was sold; Lord Ardmorne bought it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>then we knew Mr. Wallace was living on his
wife’s small fortune; then we heard the boys
had gone to the bad, as all such boys do; then
we understood the young ladies were governesses
and companions, <i><span lang="fr">voilà tout</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think they will like to see you?”
Grace asked, feeling that if she were in the
Wallaces’ position her spirits would not be
particularly elated by the visit.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot tell whether they will care to see
me,” answered Mrs. Hartley, “but I know
they will be glad to say I have called. The
twelve-and-sixpence this expedition must cost
me would have been better in their pockets,
no doubt, but there is a difficulty about suggesting
an idea of that kind. The young
ladies occasionally send me purses and useless
articles of a similar description to dispose of
amongst my friends, but as I have no friends
who would buy them—at least, as I should
be very sorry to ask my friends to do anything
of the sort—I send my own money to the fair
sellers and the goods to the next bazaar held
for charitable or religious purposes. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>always a pity for the children of the last
owner in such a case as this; for them all the
harass, all the mortification, all the petty shifts,
all the contemptible meannesses which genteel
poverty is forced to practise; for them no
cakes and ale, other people have had all that
before they were thought of.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is very hard for them,” Grace agreed;
and she thought it eminently hard for the
Wallaces when she found them “taking holiday”
in poor lodgings, where they could have
only one sitting-room, filled at low water with
a fine odour of wholesome tar, and unwholesome
sea and land waif and decaying fish;
when she beheld the once burly, reckless
squire, who had ridden after the hounds so
long as he could feed a hunter; who had sung
the best song, told the best story, been the
most jovial companion of any man in the
county, sitting drearily in an easy-chair by the
window, dressed in old clothes that hung about
his body, amusing himself by looking through
a telescope little bigger then a child’s plaything
at the vessels in the offing.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>And then there was the mother, careworn
and prematurely old, dispensing tea, the last
hospitable offer possible for her to make in their
altered circumstances, too genuine a gentle-woman
to apologize for the poverty of their
surroundings, too absolutely a woman not to
feel the change of position bitterly; the girls
making the best of things and their holidays
at the same time; talking of the kindness of
the friends with whom they had been “staying,”
of the pleasant places they had seen,
of the great people, far enough away from
Kilcurragh and their real life you may be sure—they
had met.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there were gray streaks in Miss
Wallace’s hair, though any one, to have heard
her talk, might readily have imagined she
had really spent the years since her father
left Glenwellan in travelling about for her own
pleasure, and visiting on equal terms the nobility
and gentry of the United Kingdom;
whilst the beauty, the youngest, had lost her
looks, and it was hopeless that even the size
and colour of her once celebrated eyes should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>yet win her a husband rich enough and foolish
enough to try to reinstate her family in their
former rank.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pitiful—yes, indeed it was—to see the
struggle those people waged between trying to
forget the privations of their actual present
and striving to remember the adventitious
glories of their best-to-be-forgotten past.</p>

<p class='c010'>Terrible! ay, truly, the fight to preserve
appearances, to keep up a semblance of their
old position by means of that rank impostor
called genteel poverty; as if poverty could ever
be genteel, as though the moment it tried to be
any thing besides respectable, it did not stand
a good chance of becoming disreputable.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the depth of this reverse Grace had seen
with her own eyes, all the comments which
friends, enemies, and acquaintances could make
upon it she had heard with her own ears, and
though none of the Rileys, excepting John and
the General, had ever been prime favourites
with this favoured one of fortune, still there
was something dreadful in the bare idea of
people who had once held up their heads in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>the land exchanging the anxieties of how to
keep a fine estate for the worse trouble of
considering how to provide daily bread.
John would have to maintain them; but then,
unless he was doing remarkably well, how
could he compass that if he were ever to
marry? Perhaps he never would marry,
though that seemed an unlikely solution of
the difficulty. Perhaps some of his sisters
might marry, which, considering the state of
Ireland and their fortunes, and the extreme
disproportion of marriageable girls and marrying
men, seemed more unlikely still.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly a fresh idea struck Grace. The
girls would go to India. Why had not they
gone before? All girls who had no money
and any relations in India went there, and
they all married well, and came home, according
to Mrs. Hartley, lazy and delicate.</p>

<p class='c010'>But then perhaps John, who had peculiar
and straitlaced notions concerning women,
would object to engage with his sisters in a
matrimonial speculation of that description;
and indeed Grace felt no doubt he would.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Well, then, so long as he remained single, if
the worst came to the worst, in other words,
supposing Woodbrook were lost, he would be
able to contribute to the support of his family;
and when he married, his wife would ask one
of the girls to go and live with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, supposing that one girl married well,
she could invite another to stay with her, and
so the whole family would in due time be
provided for.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not a nice way, perhaps, of getting
over the difficulty; but still, when people get
very poor, and the choice lies between marrying
a stranger and entering a strange family
as governess, people generally choose, when
practicable, to marry the strange man.</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace had seen such cases, and had heard
of many others, which set her wondering
whether, in the event of her fortune making
wings for itself, she could bring herself to
contemplate a <i><span lang="fr">mariage de convenance</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>No, she decided. She would rather go out
as a governess or seek a situation as companion.
Some people may say this showed she knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>rather less of governesses and companions even
than of marriage, but I think it was true for all
that.</p>

<p class='c010'>Spite of her money, her apparent worldliness,
her determination to have no man for lover or
husband who should not be able to bring as
much in the way of fortune at least as she,
Grace Moffat was really made of that sort of
flesh and blood to whom the idea of being sold,
or selling itself, is utterly and totally repugnant,
impossible of achievement. She could, had
reverses come, have earned her living as a
governess, for she was very fond of children,
loved them in the abstract, loved them practically;
or she might have tried to humour
the whims of sickness, and lighten the cares
and ailments of age, for she had a high sense
of duty, a keen comprehension of an often forgotten
truth that when anything is given much
has frequently to be returned, but she could
not have married for a home.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is not much praise perhaps due to her
for this. Marriage and love, like many other
things, are to a great extent matters of feeling.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Her feeling concerning them was strong. For
instance, when once she found Mr. Robert
Somerford had been playing at fast and loose
with her, not all the titles in England, not all
the money in the Bank of Ireland, could have
reconciled her to his suit.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was quite on the cards she might make an
insane match some day, and repent it to the
last hour of her life; but at all events she would
not make it with her eyes open.</p>

<p class='c010'>For these and other reasons the notion of
John Riley’s sisters going out to India to
establish themselves as he had done, to seek
his fortune, did not recommend itself to her
sentiments, but it did to her common sense.
After all, there was nothing so exceptionally
refined about the Misses Riley as to render the
idea repugnant to them. Why, then, did they
not, had they not gone? Grace could only
solve the problem in one way. John did not
wish them to go—poor John—dear old plain-featured
John? why could he not have been
content and liked her as she liked him? Why
had he gone away and left his father in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>hands of the Philistines? Of course she should
write to Mrs. Hartley. What could Mrs.
Hartley do, what would she say?</p>

<p class='c010'>Altogether it was so astounding a thing to
contemplate, even the possibility of Mr. Brady
ousting out the Rileys and ensconcing himself
in the Woodbrook nest, that Grace’s mind
refused to accept it as a possibility. Nevertheless
she could not help wondering whether,
in the event of the Rileys leaving, the next
tenant would paint the entrance gates and
repair the lodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If John were at home, I should ask him to
have the trelliswork on the West Lodge nailed
up,” thought Grace; “but of course, as he is
not, I dare not mention the matter to any one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>People who have plenty of money are able
to attend to details which to people who have
only plenty of worry seem maddeningly small.</p>

<p class='c010'>The latter, under the pressure of great
trouble, consider trifles as of no importance,
never thinking that trifles to the world are as
straws, showing which quarter the winds of
fortune blow from.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Spite of these incongruities of thought,
however, the very idea of Mr. Brady taking
possession of Woodbrook seemed like a hideous
nightmare. That he should step into the
Castle Farm was bad enough, but that he
should also annex Woodbrook appeared impossible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless Nettie had assured her such a
change of owners was not merely possible, but
probable; and if this were really the case, and
Grace’s common sense saw no reason to doubt
the fact, steps ought immediately to be taken
to avert such a calamity.</p>

<p class='c010'>But how were they to be taken, and by
whom? If, next day, Mrs. Hartley were put
in possession of the facts, what would she do?
what could she do if she would?</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Nettie who had suggested Mrs.
Hartley, but the result of Grace’s musings
tended towards consulting her father.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was a man, and, spite of her anti-matrimonial
views, Grace had more faith in the
capabilities of men than of women; of late
she and her father had been much more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>together than was hitherto the case; her cousin
was gone, and neither Mr. Moffat nor his
daughter strove to fill her place with another
companion.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were happier alone. People said
Grace was growing like her father, and that as
she got older she would feel as great a distaste
for general society as he; but this was not
quite true; Grace loved long quiet walks, but
the company of her fellows had its charms for
her as well. Still she and her father had dovetailed
into companionship. Her enthusiasm
had fitted itself somehow naturally into his
indifference. She was content he should laugh
at her. He was more than content perhaps to
tolerate her impetuosity, her indiscriminate
charity, her wide sympathy with, and ready
inclination to help, the poor.</p>

<p class='c010'>If study had taught him as little as it
usually does most scholars of things likely
to be useful in daily life, it had at least
imbued him with toleration towards his own
daughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>It enabled him to draw inferences about her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>which a less educated man would have arrived
at by means of intuition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had she been more selfish, less unsophisticated,
would she have loved him so much,
herself so little? He had but one trouble
about her, she was a very lonely maiden.
Before he went he would like to have seen her
married.</p>

<p class='c010'>To whom? That was the difficulty. After
Robert Somerford’s defection, he could not,
looking around on the various men who aspired
to his daughter’s hand, look upon one of them
with favour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” he reflected, “single happiness is
better than double misery, nevertheless I could
wish to have seen my Grace the wife of some
honest gentleman ere this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Honest gentlemen, however, are always a
little shy about trying to win heiresses, and so
father and daughter, having been thrown much
together of late, had learned to understand
each other better and love each other more.</p>

<p class='c010'>For which reason Grace resolved to take
Mr. Moffat into her confidence. If she told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>him she was not at liberty to name her informant,
he would trouble her with no questions,
and his daughter had an instinctive feeling
that, if by any means Woodbrook could be
preserved to the Rileys, he would find that
means.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had been willing to help her in the
matter of the Scotts, and only failed to do so
because it was a matter in which no help
could be given.</p>

<p class='c010'>He would be able perhaps to make some
useful suggestions, at any rate she would talk
the matter over with him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='large'>WHEN DOCTORS DIFFER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Decided as to the course she should pursue,
Grace quickened her steps, and proceeded at a
more rapid pace along the broad, gravelled
walk, where the branches of the trees and
rare shrubs which abounded at Bayview
drooped over the murmuring sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the semi-darkness she could see her home;
an oblong substantial house, with its windows
opening on two sides to terraces commanding
wide and beautiful views over land and water.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some former owner of Bayview, possessed
of that taste for landscape gardening which at
one time must have been as distinguishing a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>trait of Irish character as it now appears to be
of English, had lodged Bayview in a perfect
bowery of all rare and exquisite shrubs; shrubs
that, though they have become common enough
since and easy enough of purchase, are still
not so generally to be found planted in the
grounds surrounding houses of moderate pretensions,
owned by gentlemen of modest though
sufficient income, as they should. Between
the French windows were trained, on trelliswork
against the wall, myrtles that grew
luxuriantly out-of-doors, and were covered
year after year with bud and flower. Peeping
here and there through the dark green foliage,
and laying their bright cheeks against the
white myrtle blossoms, were roses, pink and
red. Pyracantha, honeysuckles, magnolias,
and a creeper with great leaves, the name of
which I never knew, the like of which I have
never seen elsewhere, filled up other spaces
and covered the bed-room windows with a
marvellous amount of varied greenery. A
hedge of sweet-briar, along which passionflowers
trailed in wild profusion, growing as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>freely as briony and convolvulus elsewhere,
divided the southern terrace and pleasure-grounds
from the kitchen-gardens, whilst the
western terrace terminated in a flight of stone
steps, with heavy stone balustrades, leading on
to the avenue.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beyond the terrace lay the lawns and shrubberies,
the former studded with artistically-placed
groups of trees and evergreens, the
latter a tangled mass of tangled surprises to
visitors who found themselves one moment
admiring the golden flowers of the common
laburnum and the next pausing to look at a
magnificent Italian broom; who could scarcely
believe the Portuguese laurel could ever bloom
with such a lavish wealth of white cones as
they beheld rising tier over tier above their
heads; who rubbed their fingers gently up the
stem of the velvety shumach and ate syringa
leaves, that resemble cucumbers in their flavour,
and broke buds off the clustering bunches of
yellow roses; while young ladies twined sprays
of that exquisite little plant known to simple
people by no long Latin name, but only as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“the bridal wreath,” or permitted long pendants
of the lilac laburnum to float in the
breeze with their curls.</p>

<p class='c010'>A chapter would scarce suffice me to catalogue
the names of the shrubs and trees for
the possession of which Bayview was famous;
but Grace knew them all by heart. She knew
the dewy mornings and the fine evenings after
rain, when the sweet-briar gave forth its
sweetest fragrance. She knew where the earliest
bouquets of lily of the valley were to be
gathered, the sheltered nooks where grew
primroses and violets were not hidden from
her. From a child she had been acquainted
with the haunt of the wood anemone, and the
sunny spots where lady’s fingers made soft
cushions of yellow and brown and green; and
when the little boys and girls, her tiny friends
from Kingslough, came out to spend a day at
Bayview, who could show them so well as she
the exact bend in the shallow stream where
“apple-pie” grew sweet and tall amongst
reeds and “sagans,” or that piece of undrained
ground where the rushes stood thick enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>to delight the hearts of those who had come
trooping out to make swords and parasols and
butterfly cages?</p>

<p class='c010'>And scarcely a nook, or dell, or upland, or
winding walk, or ripple of the stream over the
stones but was associated somehow or another
with John Riley. Here he had carried her
over the stepping-stones when they seemed too
wet and slippery for her childish feet; there
he held her hand tight while she jumped over
a little ravine. She could not help remembering
the day when he climbed the pine-tree
and shook the firs to obtain cones to fill her
basket, which he subsequently carried home.
She had dragged him out to bonfires in the
fields, and insisted on his roasting potatoes for,
and eating them afterwards with, her; which
was not a form of entertainment John Riley
relished. She remembered the very hour, and
day, and minute when he put the strings of a
tartan velvet bag, the possession whereof made
her exceeding proud, round her neck, and
called it her pannier, and how she slapped his
face, and how her father, coming up at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>moment, was exceeding angry, and how John
made all peace between them with a few pleasant
words. They had gathered shells together,
and collected sea-weeds, and made arbours of
fir-branches, and paved them with cockleshells.
And now she was a child no longer,
no longer a girl, quite a young woman, who
but for her exceeding beauty would already
have been called an old maid, and the pleasant
days were over, and John, having made a
mistake in loving Grace Moffat, was in India;
and Grace Moffat in Ireland was thinking how,
if she loved Bayview so much, John would
endure the idea of losing Woodbrook, which
was not merely a residence, but an estate, a
place any nobleman might have liked to own
and beautify!</p>

<p class='c010'>Of late a word has become fashionable in
leaders and novels which appears to me frequently
used without just cause; its constant
iteration at all events sounds unpleasant in
my own ears.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless, employed with caution, it is
an expressive word, and I must therefore be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>excused when I say the most dependable sort
of pity is that which is cumulative. I mean
that in which one layer of compassion is added
to another till a compact and dependable whole
is erected upon a sufficient foundation.</p>

<p class='c010'>This pity Grace Moffat now experienced for
the Rileys. At first it had rather vexed her
to think she should be called upon to sympathize
in or interfere with the troubles of
people who were so much less than nothing to
her, that towards some members of the family
at all events she felt almost antagonistic. But
a little reflection, and perhaps the warning,
sorrowful, sobbing of the waves softened her
heart. She thought of Nettie, once so dear to
her, who of her own act had alienated all old
friends, who would have nothing now to do
with old friends, let them beg never so hard
for her intimacy. She thought of the Glendares
and the Somerfords, whose liking for her
had been transient as spring sunshine. She
thought of Mrs. Hartley, who, long before, must,
like a sensible woman, have formed fresh acquaintances,
and taken them (and their English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>accent) more cordially to her bosom than she
had ever done any one of the inhabitants of
Kingslough or its vicinity. She thought of
Amos Scott, who would have none of her help
unless it could be given in his own way. She
thought of her pensioners, who, if she died
the next day, would, spite of their Presbyterian
and predestinarian ideas, say from the mere
force of habit contracted by long intercourse
with Roman Catholics, “God rest her; it’s
herself was a good lady!” and greet a charitable
successor with, “God bless her; it’s herself
that’s a kind lady!” and then she thought of
the love she had once thought of comparatively
little account—that of her father. She had
him, she had her home, but what had John
Riley?</p>

<p class='c010'>He might have made friends, no doubt, but
friends are no enduring possession. He might
have formed a fresh attachment, but in India
it was unlikely the object of that attachment
would be a lady largely endowed with this
world’s goods. He might have won golden
opinions, but something more than these is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>needful to make a man prosperous and
happy.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had his family, but supposing the members
composing it were reduced to poverty,
what should they profit him? At his father’s
death, Woodbrook, encumbered, beautiful
Woodbrook, must come to him, if it were saved
from Mr. Brady; but in either case, what a
future presented itself! Woodbrook his, with
its mortgages, and burdened by the maintenance
of his mothers and sisters; Woodbrook
not his, and both parents and his sister to
provide for.</p>

<p class='c010'>Poor John, whom she could remember lighthearted
John, it was a hard lot to contemplate!
Each generation had remained true to the traditions
of the family, and made the Riley
position worse, Would John make it worse,
even if Mr. Brady did not? Would he marry
some girl without a shilling, and perpetuate
the poverty that had for generations been as
certain an inheritance as Woodbrook?</p>

<p class='c010'>It all seemed very dark to Grace, very dark
and pitiful. Even to those who have tasted of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>its bitterness, the draught of misfortune does
not appear so unendurable a potion to swallow
as to those who have had nothing but sweets
presented to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace dreaded poverty, the rich generally
do, and as she thought of her own fair home,
a great pity for John Riley, a pity different
from anything she had ever previously felt for
any one, welled up in her heart. It seemed
only like yesterday that she had given him
his dismissal, and never an honester suitor had
asked her hand since then.</p>

<p class='c010'>She would go straight to her father and tell
him what she had heard, and with this intention
Grace passed into the house through one
of the windows opening on to the terrace.</p>

<p class='c010'>The room she entered was yet unlighted,
and she was about to ring for candles, when,
recollecting that she still wore her shawl and
bonnet, she crossed the apartment with the
intention of changing her dress before summoning
a servant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though there was nothing unusual in the
fact of her rambling about the grounds after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>dusk, on the present occasion the feeling that
she had something to conceal induced her to
seek concealment; and she was hastening to
her dressing-room, when in the hall the cook,
with white, startled face, confronted her,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ve been looking for you everywhere,
Miss Grace. The master—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace laid her hand on the back of a chair
to steady herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the matter?” she asked; “what
has happened? where is my father?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is in his own room, Miss Grace, and
the doctors with him. He was took—”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Grace waited to hear no more, she ran
up the staircase, and along the corridor to a
room at the extreme end, the door of which
stood open.</p>

<p class='c010'>She could hear a man speaking in a voice
hushed yet excited, evidently insisting upon
some course antagonistic to his auditor, and as
she paused for one second in her progress,
that auditor replied in cool, clear tones,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will wait till Miss Moffat comes; she
shall decide between us.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>“But I tell you I must do it. Would you
have me see the man die before my eyes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I tell you it shall not be done,” the other
answered, adding immediately, “Here is Miss
Moffat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace did not greet either of them; she
went straight over to the bed where lay her
father, apparently lifeless.</p>

<p class='c010'>His head rested on the pillow, his grey hair
fell tangled about his face, his eyes were closed,
his arms hung powerless beside his body, and
his hands, white, wan, and nerveless, were as
the hands of a corpse.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had courage, there was no question
about that; she had received the most fearful
shock a human being can sustain, and yet she
neither wept, shrieked, nor exclaimed. Had
she been alone with him, there is little doubt
she would have flung herself beside the bed
and sobbed and cried like any other woman;
but before the strangers present, strangers at
the moment, though they were only Doctor
Girvan and Mr. Hanlon, and some of the
servants, she could not lay bare her heart;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and involuntarily all in the room were silenced
for the moment by her silence, calmed by
her calmness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it?” she asked, speaking to
Doctor Girvan, but including Mr. Hanlon in
her question by a look.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Apoplexy,” said the Doctor unhesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is no such thing,” declared Mr. Hanlon
stoutly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And he should be bled instantly,” continued
Dr. Girvan, ignoring his opponent’s remark,
and fingering his lancet lovingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Moffat, so certainly as your father
is bled he is a dead man,” exclaimed Mr.
Hanlon earnestly. “If Dr. Girvan persists
in bleeding, I must decline to be associated
with him in the treatment of the
case.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And if I don’t bleed him,” said Dr. Girvan,
“there will be no case to treat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace looked at the motionless figure, then
at the old doctor trembling with anger, striving
to repress the fury he felt it would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>unseemly to show, and again at the handsome
confident face of the younger man.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had known Dr. Girvan since she had
known anything; he was their regular attendant;
in all her childish ailments he had
given her kind words and smiles, and sent her
detestable medicines; when in her later years
she caught cold and was troubled with cough,
sore throat, or any other malady, he and none
other had treated her. For well-nigh half a
century he had cured or killed the gentry of
Kingslough and its neighbourhood, and there
was comfort in that reflection. To be sure he
knew nothing, and professed to know nothing,
of new-fangled ways; but then the fashion of
living and dying is one which knows little
alteration. Being born, being buried, are
matters susceptible of so little change that
Grace might well be excused if in her extremity
she fastened her gaze more confidently
on the old light than on the new. Mr. Hanlon
might be very clever, but after all he could
not have Dr. Girvan’s experience.</p>

<p class='c010'>Encouraged by her manifest leaning to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>his view of the case, the latter said
eagerly,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Each instant is precious, Miss Grace.
Had I alone been summoned, I should have
let blood the moment I came.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As I objected to your doing so, our
patient has still a chance of living,” observed
Mr. Hanlon, without the least sign of excitement;
“but now, if Miss Moffat wishes, I
will at once retire from the room and the
case.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No—no, pray stay!” she entreated!</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot remain unless I am allowed to
pursue my own course of treatment,” said
Doctor Girvan.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I said we would leave it for Miss Moffat
to decide,” remarked Mr. Hanlon, with exasperating
civility, but with an anxious look in
his face nevertheless. “Doctor Girvan says
this attack is apoplectic, and should be treated
by bleeding. I say it is not apoplectic, and
that bleeding may be a fatal error.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I tell you I have seen a score of cases of
apoplectic seizures for one that can have come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>across you,” said Doctor Girvan, advancing to
the patient. “And I have attended Mr.
Moffat and Mr. Moffat’s family—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let his daughter speak,” interrupted Mr.
Hanlon, speaking sternly and peremptorily.
“Miss Moffat, the decision rests with
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is cruel of you to force such a responsibility
upon me,” said Grace hoarsely.
“You understand medicine, I do not; save
him,” she added, pointing towards her father,
“that is all I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, Miss Moffat,” began Mr. Hanlon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! stand back, can’t you?” exclaimed
Doctor Girvan brusquely; “we’re wasting
precious time in child’s talk. And indeed you
are right, Miss Grace, and it was cruel to try
to lay such a burden on you; but never mind,
I’ll take all the responsibility upon myself.
Now if you’ll just walk out of the room for a
minute or two—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A moment,” interrupted Mr. Hanlon.
“Miss Moffat, what I am doing may be unprofessional.
Nevertheless I remonstrate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>against Doctor Girvan’s proposed course of
treatment, and implore you not to countenance
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To hear you, anybody might think I
was not ten years of age,” remarked the
Doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Moffat, speak for mercy’s sake!”
implored Mr. Hanlon; “I pledge my reputation
this is no apoplectic fit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As if you should know!” muttered
Doctor Girvan contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Though I was sent for, I feel I am an
intruder here,” continued Mr. Hanlon, unheeding
the interruption.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is true at any rate. Indeed and
you are,” commented Doctor Girvan.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I cannot—being here—see a man
bled to death without entering my protest
against such a proceeding.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you be quiet?” requested Doctor
Girvan; “can’t you see you are wringing his
daughter’s heart?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Moffat, will you trust your father to
me?” asked Mr. Hanlon.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“Sure the doctor must know best,”
whispered a housemaid, on whom the new
comer’s youth and good looks had made no
impression.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed, and Miss Grace,” ventured the
butler, who had always been accustomed to
volunteer his advice and opinions, as is the not
unpleasing habit of all Irish servants, from the
highest to the lowest, the highest perhaps the
most frequently. “Indeed, an’ Miss Grace,
I think if the masther himself could speak,
which send he may soon, he would say,
lave it to the docthor, and let him bleed
me freely.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Moffat, won’t you speak?” said
Mr. Hanlon, glancing at the two last speakers
looks that went through them, so they subsequently
averred, like flashes of lightning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have lost too much time already,”
said Dr. Girvan, with an air of busy importance,
for he saw Grace, though divided,
felt inclined to walk in the old footsteps.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Hanlon,” she said, “I do not trust
you less because I trust Doctor Girvan more;”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>then she stooped and kissed brow, and lip,
and cheek of the man lying there motionless,
and after saying, “Doctor, you would not
deceive me, you will save my father,” left the
room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Hanlon followed her. She did not go
downstairs, but stood in the corridor, leaning
against the wall. He went into one of the
rooms close at hand, and fetched her a chair,
then he retreated a few steps, and remained
with head bent and hands plunged in his
pockets, looking gloomily at the pattern of
the carpet.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was silence for a minute, which he
broke by saying,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can do nothing more here, so I will bid
you good-night, Miss Moffat. May I send any
of the servants up to you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She put out her hand, which he took
and held. “Do not go; oh, pray, pray
stay!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I assure you—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind assuring me; stay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Doctor Girvan does not wish it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“I wish it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was very hard to hold out, but still Mr.
Hanlon made a feint of doing so.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In my private capacity, Miss Moffat, I
would do anything on earth to oblige you, but
in my professional—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forget your professional pride for a little
while,” she entreated. “You told me to
decide; and how could I decide otherwise,
when we had known him so long, when my
father trusted him so much?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not see how you could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you will stay?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I stay, will you do something for me in
return?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me what it is?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Send to Kilcurragh for Doctor Murney,
and to Glenwellan for Doctor Connelley;
send without a moment’s delay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You think he is in such danger?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned his face away; he could not
bear she should see the answer he knew was
written there.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do as you like!” she said feebly. “I leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>it all to you. I—I must go to him now,” and
she rose and walked a step or two towards
the room where her father lay, then paused,
wavered, and would have fallen, but that Mr.
Hanlon, anticipating this result, caught her in
his arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>He carried her into the room whence he had
brought the chair, and, laying her on a sofa,
left her, without making even an effort to
restore her to consciousness, but, hastening
downstairs, found the cook, whom he sent to
her mistress, saying,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“She has fainted, but don’t try to bring
her to. I shall see her again in a few
minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Which are the best pair of horses you
have in the stables, Mick?” he asked, addressing
the groom, who was in the kitchen,
waiting to hear if he was likely to be
wanted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is the masther, yer honour?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Badly enough, and likely to be worse,”
was the answer; “but about the horses?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Grace’s mare is the fastest, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>bay the masther, preserve him, bought last
month, has a power of outcome in him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who is there here you can trust to take
one of them to Glenwellan with a note for
Doctor Connelley?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure and I can ride there myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I want you to go to Kilcurragh and
bring back Doctor Murney. You had best
take the tax-cart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Save us, Doctor; is he that bad?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, quite as bad as that,” Mr. Hanlon
answered. “Some of you help Mick with the
harness. I will have the notes ready by the
time you are.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mightily astonished was the mare at having
a saddle slipped on her at that time of night;
pettishly she champed the bit and struck
her off forefoot against the rough pavement of
the yard, whilst Mick tightened her girths by
the simple expedient of planting his knee in
her stomach, pulling at the same time buckles
and straps as far home as he could get
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ride like the devil, Jerry,” were Mick’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>parting instructions, and, nothing loth to
follow such a congenial example, Jerry, after
the first mile and a half, which he took
“modtherately,” for fear of breaking the mare’s
wind, did the rest of the distance at a hard
gallop.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the beauty niver turned a hair,”
said Jerry, when reciting subsequently the
marvels of that wild ride. Perhaps if the
mare’s story told to her equine companions
could have been heard, her account of the state
of affairs would have differed slightly from
that of her rider.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for the bay, never before had that
animal’s powers of outcome been so severely
tested. Up hill and down dale it was all one
to Mick. With a whoop and a “now lad”
he lifted him into a stretching canter up the
inclines, with a tight rein and a cut of the
whip he warned him to take no false step
whilst spinning down declivities steep enough
to appal the understandings of ordinary
people.</p>

<p class='c010'>Horses and men did their best, as Irish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>horses and Irish men will in moments of excitement
and time of need, and that best
was, as is ever the case in that land of strange
contrasts, something super-excellent; but it
was all labour in vain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had they flown on the wind, had the horses
been birds, had they been able to cleave the
air with wings, the help they brought must
still have proved too late.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the first drop of blood, the chances of
life began to flutter: when the last was drawn,
and Dr. Girvan heaved a sigh of satisfaction,
hope, so far as this world was concerned, had
fled for Mr. Moffat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will do now,” said Dr. Girvan, complacently
addressing Mr. Hanlon.</p>

<p class='c010'>But that gentleman shook his head,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“We shall see,” he answered: and they
did see.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Grace recovered consciousness, she
looked around the room and her eyes rested
with an expression of mute appeal on Dr.
Girvan, who stood near.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All is going on well,” he answered. With
a murmured thanksgiving she laid her head
back against the sofa pillows, when her glance
chanced to fall on Mr. Hanlon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do not think all is well?” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have not seen the patient,” he replied.
“He is, of course, solely in Dr. Girvan’s hands
until the physicians for whom you have sent
arrive.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>“You have sent for further advice, Miss
Grace?” remarked Dr. Girvan inquiringly.
“Could you not trust me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can trust you,” she answered; “but he
is my father. I must go to him now,” and
without asking another question she went.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is your doing,” said Dr. Girvan to
Mr. Hanlon as the door of the sick chamber
closed behind her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t let us quarrel, Doctor,” replied the
younger man sadly, and not without a certain
dignity. “Before very long, I am afraid you
will find something is <em>your</em> doing, which you
will regret till the last hour of your life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think, Sir, I do not understand
my business?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you have misunderstood this case.
Mr. Moffat is as good as a dead man, and you
have killed him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After delivering himself of which pleasant
utterance, Mr. Hanlon walked out of the room,
down the stairs, and out into the night.</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not go home; not a thought of
deserting Grace Moffat in her extremity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>occurred to this man, who if he was foolish
was chivalrous. He passed through the still
unlighted apartments, and made his way on to
the terrace. There he paced up and down,
inhaling the fragrance of the flowers and
shrubs; listening to the wind rustling among
the trees, and the murmur of the sea washing
in upon the shore; thinking of the man
stricken so suddenly; thinking of the woman so
grand in her sorrow, so quiet in her grief, and
of something else also which if now told would
reveal whatever plot this poor story holds.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are times when the mind seems a mere
mirror, when it can only receive the impression
of that immediately presented before it. In
all times of sudden and agonized trouble, I
think this is the case. When a fearful accident
occurs, it is to the latest telegram we all
instinctively direct our eyes, whether the
accident concerns us personally or not; and
in like manner when some calamity comes to
pass, which involves us and those dear to us,
we dwell on the result, never troubling ourselves
to inquire into details, until we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>recovered from the effect of the first swift and
stunning blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was thus with Grace Moffat at all events.
She did not know, she did not ask to know,
how the seizure occurred. She had never
been with sickness, was utterly ignorant of the
fact that a woman ought to know almost as
much of illness as a doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Afterwards she understood that when the
butler, supposing his master had long left the
dining-room, entered that apartment he found
Mr. Moffat lying face downwards on the floor;
that he, having despatched “Jamesey”—an
odd boy who loafed about the kitchen and had
no settled position or employment, unless it
might be to bear the blame of all faults committed,
and perform all work left undone by
every one else—for the doctor, the lad rushing
down the road was encountered by two retainers
of the house of Moffat, who, hearing the news,
started off, one with Jamesey to Dr. Girvan,
the other by himself to Mr. Hanlon. There
were factions at Bayview, as in every other
establishment in Ireland; some of the servants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>inclining to old ways and people including Dr.
Girvan, and others leaning to the new school
of which in Kingslough Mr. Hanlon was the
exponent.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were those in the town who could not
have died happily had the young surgeon tried
to cure them; there were others who would
scarcely have accepted life at the hands of Dr.
Girvan: and thus it came to pass that both
men were sent for, and both arrived within a
few minutes of each other.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then commenced the disagreement terminated
by Grace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am no better than a coward,” thought
Mr. Hanlon, as he walked up and down through
the night. “Why did I ever leave the matter
for him to decide? When he is gone she will
continually be reproaching herself. I ought
to have insisted on sending for Murney at
once; I ought to have kept that doting idiot
off his prey by force if necessary.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At that moment a hand was laid on his arm.
It belonged to Grace, who had come so softly
along the terrace that he failed to hear her
footsteps. “Mr. Hanlon,” she began.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>“Yes, Miss Moffat?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want you to tell me the truth,” she
said. “Never mind medical etiquette. Forget
you are a doctor, that I am <em>his</em> daughter;
speak to me as you might to a stranger. What
do you think of him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think he is in the hands of God,”
answered Mr. Hanlon. The demagogues of
those days had one advantage over the demagogues
of this; they did acknowledge a power
higher than themselves, and were occasionally
awed by the remembrance of its existence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what can man do?” she asked, her
sweet voice shrill with the anguish of her soul.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We shall know when the other doctors
come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She understood he had no hope; and she
stood for a moment silent, listening all unconsciously
to the sobbing of the sea, to the
sighing of the night wind through the trees, to
the voices of silence that keep whispering
and ever muttering through the darkness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Already the lonely, awful journey seemed
begun; over the waters something blacker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>than night hovered. The mighty angel with
the slow wings brooded over the place. The
scent of the flowers appeared to her heavy and
sickly, the slight breeze as it touched her
cheek failed to refresh her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us go in,” she said, “the darkness
frightens me,” and she drew him into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come upstairs,” she pleaded. “See if
something cannot be done. Come and look at
him. Forget you are a doctor; think of
yourself only as a friend. Don’t stand upon
your dignity. Help me, I am so lonely. He
is all I have in the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Moffat, if by dying this night I could
save your father, I would do it. These are
not idle words. There is no one who would
miss me much after the first. Some one would
take up my work where I laid it down and
finish it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And there he suddenly stopped, and she
instinctively withdrew her hand; and then
with the impulse of a higher and nobler
womanhood, which raised Grace on a loftier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>pedestal than women of her age generally
occupy, she laid it again on his arm and said,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not talk in that way; I cannot bear to
hear such words from you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because you have your life to live,” she
answered simply, “and it is not good to begin
a long journey with a weary heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A prophetic sentence, one which both recalled
when the crisis of his existence arrived.</p>

<p class='c010'>Side by side they ascended the staircase, and
stepped lightly along the corridor, and entered
the room where Mr. Moffat lay.</p>

<p class='c010'>Already Dr. Girvan’s confidence in the correctness
of his diagnosis was shaken. There
was something in the look of the man who lay
there, still insensible, which he had never seen
in the face of one who came back from the
borders of the Valley of the Shadow. According
to his anticipations, the patient should
already have been exhibiting some sign of
recovery, some token, however slight, of
returning animation; but there was no change
as yet, none, unless it might be that the colour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>was of a more leaden pallor, that the hand
he touched lay more like that of a dead man,
that it became difficult to hear the breath, that
in a word no symptom he had calculated upon
showed itself, that on the contrary all the
symptoms were unlike those he had mentally
predicted must appear.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, as Dr. Girvan himself would have
said, he had not lived his life for nothing; old-fashioned
he could fairly be called, bigoted he
might be; ignorant of the latest discoveries,
behind the age in many things he undoubtedly
was, but by no means a fool in his profession.
He did not know what was the matter with
Mr. Moffat, but he was almost certain now
that he had mistaken his ailment, and if so—</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you think of him?” he whispered
to Mr. Hanlon, after another doubtful look at
his patient.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Hanlon shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you think of anything?” A clammy
perspiration was standing on his forehead and
his hands were shaking with nervous dread as
he asked the question.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“The others may. As things are I should
be afraid to try.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t be afraid, man. If there is anything
can be done let us try it. I will take the
blame if blame there be. Only don’t let us
see him die before our eyes without lifting a
hand to save him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you talking about?” Grace
asked at this juncture, crossing to where they
stood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are consulting, Miss Moffat,” answered
Mr. Hanlon; then turning to Dr.
Girvan, he said, “I should try a stimulant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A stimulant in apoplexy!” exclaimed the
older man in an accent of horror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not apoplexy, and if it were, in
this case, I should try it still.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not know what to say I am sure,” remarked
Dr. Girvan. But Mr. Hanlon cut
short the discussion by himself going for
what he wanted, and administering it to their
patient.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a short while a little tremor could be
observed, and a slight decrease in the ghastly
whiteness of the sick man’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>“That has done him good,” said Dr. Girvan
in a tone of relief. “What should you think
of trying a little more?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you like,” answered Mr. Hanlon; then
added, “Now we will let him rest till Murney
and Connelley come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And they sat down; Dr. Girvan close beside
the bed, Mr. Hanlon beside one of the windows
looking towards the east, where the first
streaks of dawn were already appearing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Grace came to him as he sat there. “What
do you think of my father now?” she asked,
and he saw that her large eyes were heavy
with the weight of unshed tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can only repeat that he is in the hands
of God,” answered Mr. Hanlon, rising and
offering her his seat. “Man could tell you no
more than that, till some change occur for
better or for worse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She took his chair, and drawing another to
the window, Mr. Hanlon seated himself near
her, and whilst both their eyes involuntarily
sought the east, their thoughts wandered
silently and sadly on their separate ways.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“They are here!” Grace at length exclaimed.
Her strained ear had been the first
to catch the sound of wheels. That beauty
the mare was not back before the horse with
the “power of outcome in him;” but ere
another half-hour, Dr. Connelley, who had
ridden Mr. Moffat’s latest purchase, leaving
Jerry to follow with his own hack, was also in
the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You had better go down to him,” said Mr.
Hanlon to Dr. Girvan; he did not wish to influence
Dr. Murney’s opinion by any statement
of his own; and as the old man left the room,
he added, speaking to Grace,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you had better not stay here. I
will come to you presently.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And tell me exactly what they say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He hesitated for a moment, then answered,
“Yes, Miss Moffat, I promise.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile, Dr. Murney was ascending the
staircase. In Kilcurragh, a large and important
town, he held high rank in his profession.
Had his lot been cast in Dublin, he
might have come to more honour; but he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>been a very successful man, and made money
enough to enable him to keep pace with the
times, to visit London and Paris and “rub,”
as he said “the provincial rust off his mind,”
and to enable him to entertain men great in
science, surgery, and medicine, who from time
to time crossed the Channel, and took Kilcurragh
<i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i> from Dublin to Donegal and
the Giant’s Causeway.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Girvan and he had often before met in
consultation, and Mr. Hanlon also was not
quite a stranger to him. His opinions at all
events were not; but whilst he detested them,
he was obliged to confess the young man had
brains, and might have done well would he only
have stuck to physic and left politics alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Moffat was known to him as a matter
of course; and whilst he walked along the corridor
rubbing his hands, for the night breeze
and the sea air had conjointly proved chilly,
he kept up a series of running sentences,
“Sad, sad, very sad; dear, dear, and a man
no older than myself; a man who took care of
himself also; temperate in his habits, careful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>in his diet, really these sudden attacks seem
to set all our rules at nought. Had I been
asked to name the last person I knew likely to
be attacked by apoplectic seizure, I should
have named my valued friend Moffat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>From which it will be seen that Dr. Girvan
had not summoned up sufficient courage to disabuse
the mind of his colleague of the impression
conveyed to it by Mick.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wretched man still hoped against hope
that he had not been mistaken, and he mentally
prayed, as, probably, he had never prayed
before for anything, that Dr. Murney would
confirm his first opinion. If he did, Dr.
Girvan, in his extremity, felt as if he himself
could die happily the next moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Murney entered the room silently, shook
hands with Mr. Hanlon, walked over to the
bed, looked at Mr. Moffat, felt his pulse; then,
stepping across the apartment, he took a candle
from a little table on which lights had been
placed, and returning to the bedside, leant
over the patient and studied his appearance
attentively.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>With a gloomy face Mr. Hanlon watched
these proceedings, holding his breath in a very
agony of suspense; Dr. Girvan watched them
too.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here!” said the new-comer at length,
thrusting the candle towards Mr. Hanlon, who
took it as indicated; then Dr. Murney bared
the sick man’s breast, and laid his ear against
his heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>After that he carefully, tenderly almost,
replaced the bedclothes, and stood silent for a
moment, waiting, apparently, for the others to
speak; but neither of them uttering a syllable,
he said,—“This is not apoplexy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lord forgive me,” murmured Dr. Girvan;
and he sat down on the nearest chair, covering
his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What can be done now?” asked Mr.
Hanlon, his voice hoarse with emotion he was
trying do master.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing,” replied Dr. Murney, and he
walked to the window and looked out, and
came back again to where Dr. Girvan sat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t take on so,” he said, speaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>kindly to the old man, and laying a compassionate
hand on his shoulder. “If a mistake
has been made, better men than any of us
have made mistakes before now. I am sure
you and Mr. Hanlon have acted in this matter
to the very best of your judgment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Hanlon never opened his lips; Kingslough
had not appreciated him, and Dr. Girvan,
from the first, was his enemy, but he could not
remember that now. In this hour of bitter
humiliation, of maddening remorse, he felt he
should have been less than human to add to
the old man’s self-reproach by recalling how
persistently he had refused to listen to his
remonstrances, how obstinately he had insisted
on taking his own course.</p>

<p class='c010'>No; if there were blame to be borne, they
might bear it together. All the explanations
on earth could not undo the past, could not
mend the future.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Dr. Girvan, whilst touched by his
generosity; was labouring under an agony of
repentance which refused to keep silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t you speak?” he said, lifting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>his haggard face and looking at Mr. Hanlon.
“Why don’t you tell him how the thing was?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have nothing to tell,” answered Mr.
Hanlon. “If, as Dr. Murney says, a mistake
was made, it is too late to undo it now. I
know I did my best in the case, and I am sure
you did yours. I don’t think there is anything
more to be said in the matter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Doctor, it was me.” No form of expression,
let it have been more grammatically
accurate than the speaker ever conceived,
could have gone so straight home to the
hearts of his listeners as that containing those
four words,—“Doctor, it was me.” “If the
man dies the blame lies at my door. He”—pointing
to Mr. Hanlon—“told me how it
would be, and I took no heed; I hadn’t a
doubt in my own mind. I believed I was
doing right, and I did wrong, and now I wish
I was lying there in his stead. I do,” and he
broke down and cried like a child.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you said Connelley had been sent
for also?” remarked Dr. Murney after standing
silent for a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I sent for him in case you should not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>be at home,” answered Mr. Hanlon. “He
will be here directly, I should think.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad he is likely to come,” said the
other; “he may be able to make some suggestion.
Meanwhile, Dr. Girvan and I will
go downstairs and have a little talk together.”
And taking the old man’s arm he led him
towards the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Dr. Girvan turned,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mind,” he almost sobbed, “I am to tell
this to her myself; I don’t want anybody to
speak about it but me. Ah, Grace, little I
thought the hour I helped to bring you into
the world, that I would one day help to break
your heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She need never know,” exclaimed Mr. Hanlon
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Know! sure you told her yourself. Didn’t
you say, standing where you are now, you
wouldn’t see a man bled to death?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did, and more shame for me to have
spoken such words before his daughter; but
we can surely soften it to her, she need not be
told exactly how the case stands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She shall be told the truth; maybe then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>she’ll forgive me some time, though I can
never forgive myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you needn’t tell her now at any
rate,” interrupted Doctor Murney; “come
with me. There’s many a mistake of this sort
made that is never found out either by doctors
themselves or the friends of those they have
been attending.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A pleasant confession,” thought Mr. Hanlon
as he once again seated himself by the
window and resumed his watch for dawn.</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly the streaks of light became broader,
day gently pushed aside the curtains of night
from the sea, darkness lifted itself gradually,
the clouds became suffused with crimson, then
the sun appeared above the horizon, and once
again the ever-recurring miracle of a new day
had been wrought upon the earth.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
